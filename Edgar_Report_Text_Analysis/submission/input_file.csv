MANAGEMENT\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONYEAR ENDED DECEMBER , COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER , In November , the Company initiated a major restructuring and growthplan designed to substantially reduce its cost structure and grow the businessin order to restore higher levels of profitability for the Company. By July, the Company completed the major phases of the restructuring plan. The. million of annualized cost savings anticipated from the restructuringresults primarily from the consolidation of administrative functions within theCompany, the rationalization of manufacturing and warehouse facilities(including a reduction in the number of production facilities from to andwarehouses from to ), the elimination of over , positions (including, from the divestiture of non-core businesses described below andapproximately , other positions), the centralization of the Company\'sprocurement function and re-negotiation of supply contracts resulting inprocurement savings for raw materials, components and sourced finished productsand the reduction of the Company\'s product offerings and stock keeping units(""SKU\'s""). The restructuring and growth plan also included a redefinition of theCompany\'s core product categories and the elimination of those businesses andproduct lines that did not fit the core categories. Sunbeam\'s core productcategories are Appliances, Health at Home, Personal Care and Comfort, OutdoorCooking and Away From Home. Product categories and businesses determined to benon-core were divested in , including the Company\'s furniture business andits time and temperature, decorative bedding and Counselorregistered trademarkand Borgregistered trademark scale product lines. In addition, the Companysold its textile mill in Biddeford, Maine in . Net sales from continuing operations for were ,. million, anincrease of . million or . over . Net sales on a normalized basis,after excluding divested product lines which are not classified as discontinuedoperations (time and temperature products, decorative bedding andCounselorregistered trademark and Borgregistered trademark branded scales),increased . during the year. Global sales, on a normalized basis, increased during in all five ofthe Company\'s product categories primarily from new product introductions,improved distribution (particularly with the Company\'s top ten customers),international geographic expansion and improved price realization for certainproducts. Global sales growth on a normalized basis exceeded in theAppliance, Outdoor Cooking and Away From Home categories with sales increasesof ., . and ., respectively. Sales in the Health at Home categoryincreased . on a normalized basis and sales in the Personal Care andComfort category increased . during . The Company\'s Appliance category sales increases were driven by newproducts, such as re-designed blenders and mixers, coffeemakers, irons, deepfryers and toasters, and by increased distribution with large national massretailers. Sales of Outdoor Cooking products increased in after threestraight years of declines as a result of increased merchandising andadvertising programs, new distribution and the introduction of an entirely newline of grills and accessories for the season that began to ship in thefourth quarter of under a new ""early buy"" marketing program that includedamong other things, extended credit terms with due dates in the second quarterof . The Company sold approximately . million of Outdoor CookingProducts under this program in the fourth quarter of . The early buy programfor Outdoor Cooking products is designed to improve customer service levels andproduction efficiencies with more level seasonal production and distributionactivities that have historically peaked in the first half of each year and todrive additional retail sell-through of Outdoor Cooking products by reducing thelikelihood of retail stock-outs during the important first and second quarter selling season. Sales of Personal Care and Comfort products were up over throughSeptember , but suffered during the fourth quarter as a result of lowerthan expected retail sell through of electric blankets in key northern marketsin late coupled with the inability to service demand for king and queensized blankets due to shortages of blanket shells. The Company anticipatesshifting to a more <PAGE>level production for blankets in in order to more adequately service theseasonal demand for bedding products. Health at Home category sales increasedas a result of new products and improved distribution in the drug channels.Away from Home sales increased in as a result of new products, includingcordless clippers and titanium blades coupled with increased distribution ofcommercially rated appliances. Also contributing to the Company\'s sales growthin were its new retail outlet stores, of which were open by the end of. International sales, which represented of total revenues in , grew. during the year. This sales growth was driven primarily by new volt product introductions and the execution of new internationaldistribution and license agreements. Revenue growth of approximately wasachieved both in Mexico and by the Company\'s Latin American export salesorganization, and sales in Venezuela and Canada increased approximately each. European sales fell slightly in , however the Company expects thatexpanded electric blanket and clipper sales along with the help of additionalnew distribution agreements will benefit European sales in . The gross margin percentage for increased . percentage points to.. This increase reflects the results of many cost savings and marginenhancement initiatives undertaken as part of the Company\'s restructuring plancoupled with the incremental margin attributable to new products and higherrevenues associated with the Company\'s growth plan. The Company initiated amanufacturing refinement program in the second quarter of targeted ataggressively improving factory productivity at all of its remaining operations,including the Neosho, Missouri Outdoor Cooking Products facility which sufferedfrom poor productivity and operating inefficiencies during the grillseason. The benefits of the refinement program began to favorably impactfactory productivity in several factories during the third quarter of . Therefinement of the Neosho facility, which was completed prior to the initiationof production for the grill season in the fourth quarter, included arevised plant layout to improve material flow, increased usage of common partsin the manufacturing process and modifications to the paint system to increasecapacity and throughput. Operating earnings for were . million, an increase of .million over , excluding the impact of the special charge. As apercentage of sales, the operating margin of . increased . percentagepoints above last year\'s operating margin, excluding special charges. Theoperating margin improvements for were the result of the improved grossmargin discussed above and lower selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"")costs in associated with the consolidation of six divisional and regionalheadquarters into one corporate headquarters and one administrative operationscenter, reduced staffing levels, the outsourcing of certain administrative anddistribution functions, a reduction in the number of warehouses, and Companywide cost control initiatives. In addition, SG&A during includedincremental compensation costs associated with restricted stock awards andother costs related to the employment of a new senior management team, higherthan normal expenditures for market research, packaging and other initiativesrelated to the launch of the Company\'s growth plan, and higher bad debtexpenses associated with certain of the Company\'s customers. The cost reductioninitiatives and one time items in coupled with increased sales in resulted in SG&A decreasing as a percentage of sales from . in (excluding the impact of special charges) to . for . Interest expense decreased from . million in to . million in primarily as a result of lower average borrowing levels in due toimproved cash flows. The effective income tax of for and for earnings (loss) fromcontinuing operations was lower than the statutory federal and state rates as aresult of lower foreign taxes from the utilization of foreign tax credits andloss carryforwards and lower state income taxes as a result of certain stateincome tax credits. The Company\'s diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was. per share versus a loss per share from continuing operations in of.. The Company\'s share base utilized in the diluted earnings per sharecalculation increased approximately during as a result of an increasein the number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalentsoutstanding due to the exercise of stock options and a higher market value ofthe Company\'s common stock in . <PAGE> The Company\'s discontinued furniture operations, which were sold in March, had revenues of . million in the first quarter of prior to thesale and break-even earnings.

Inaddition, SG&A costs increased due to the inclusion of the Samsoniteregisteredtrademark furniture business, higher distribution and warehousing costs,particularly with resin furniture products and higher bad debt expenses.FOREIGN OPERATIONS During approximately of the Company\'s business was conducted inU.S. dollars (including both domestic sales, U.S. dollar denominated exportsales primarily to certain Latin American markets, Asian sales and the majorityof European sales). The Company\'s exposure to market risk from changes inforeign currency and interest rates is generally insignificant. The Company\'snon-U.S. dollar denominated sales are made principally by subsidiaries inMexico, Venezuela and Canada. Venezuela is considered a hyperinflationaryeconomy for accounting purposes for , and and Mexico reverted tohyperinflationary status for accounting purposes in ; therefore, translationadjustments related to Venezuelan and Mexican net monetary assets are includedas a component of net earnings. Such translation adjustments were not materialto , and operating results. On a limited basis, the Company selectively uses derivatives (foreignexchange option and forward contracts) to manage foreign exchange exposuresthat arise in the normal course of business. No derivative contracts areentered into for trading or speculative purposes. The use of derivatives didnot have a material impact on the Company\'s financial results in , and. See Note to the Company\'s consolidated financial statements.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of December , , the Company had cash and cash equivalents of. million and total debt of . million. Cash used in operatingactivities during was . million compared to . <PAGE>million provided by operating activities in . This decrease is primarilyattributable to an increase in earnings before non-cash charges in and theutilization of tax benefits generated from the implementation of the Company\'srestructuring plan, offset by higher accounts receivable due to increased salesin and certain seasonal dating terms, increased inventory levels in necessary to support continued anticipated sales growth and the Company\'sinitiatives to improve customer service levels and cash expendituresrequired to implement the restructuring plan. In addition, cash used inoperating activities reflects million of proceeds from the sale of tradeaccounts receivable under the Company\'s revolving trade accounts receivablesecuritization program entered into in December as more fully described inNote to the Company\'s consolidated financial statements. Capital spending totaled . million in and was primarily for newproducts, cost reduction and capacity expansion initiatives. Capital spendingin was . million (including . million related to the discontinuedfurniture operations) and was primarily attributable to new productdevelopment, cost reduction initiatives and a . million warehouse expansionfinanced with a capital lease. Capital spending in reflected approximately. million associated with the Hattiesburg facility, . million relatedto new product development and . million attributable to the discontinuedfurniture business. The remaining capital spending was related to costreduction projects, productivity initiatives and environmental complianceincluding . million for a powder coat paint system for Outdoor Cookingproducts. The Company anticipates capital spending to be approximately of sales and primarily related to new product introductions, capacity additionsand certain facility rationalization initiatives. Cash provided by investing activities also reflects . million inproceeds from sales of businesses, assets and product categories determined tobe non-core to the Company\'s ongoing operations in conjunction with the restructuring plan. Cash used in investing activities for includes thepurchase of a portion of the Company\'s furniture business, which wassubsequently divested in full in March . Cash provided by financing activities totaled . million in andreflects net borrowings of . million under the Company\'s revolving creditfacility, . million of debt repayments related to the divested furnitureoperations and other assets sold and . million in cash proceeds from theexercise of stock options, substantially all by former employees of theCompany. In , cash provided by financing activities of . million wasprimarily from increased revolving credit facility borrowings to supportworking capital and capital spending requirements, . million in newissuances of long-term debt and . million in proceeds from the sale oftreasury shares to certain executives of the Company. In July , the Companyreduced the amount of available borrowings under its September unsecuredfive year revolving credit facility from million to million. The Company is a party to various environmental proceedings, substantiallyall related to previously divested operations. In connection with the Company\'srestructuring plan a comprehensive review of environmental exposures wasundertaken and the Company accelerated its strategy for the resolution andsettlement of certain environmental claims. This review and change in strategyresulted in additional environmental reserves being recorded in as morefully described in Note to the consolidated financial statements. Inmanagement\'s opinion, the ultimate resolution of these environmental matterswill not have a material adverse effect upon the Company\'s financial condition. On March , , the Company announced the signing of definitiveagreements to acquire The Coleman Company, Inc., Signature Brands USA, Inc. andFirst Alert, Inc. Completion of the acquisitions, which is expected in thesecond quarter of , is contingent on customary conditions, includingregulatory approvals, and acquisition debt issuances. In connection with theacquisitions, the Company plans to refinance existing revolving and term debt ofthe acquired companies as well as all or substantially all of its existinglong-term debt. The Company expects to finance the cash portion of theacquisitions and all debt refinancings through a combination of new revolvingand term credit facilities and zero coupon notes that will be issued concurrentwith the acquisition closings. Refer to Note for additional informationregarding the pending acquisitions. The Company believes its cash flow from operations, existing cash and cashequivalent balances, its receivable securitization program, with the proceeds ofthe anticipated new debt financings discussed above will be sufficient tosupport working capital needs, capital spending, debt service and acquisitionrelated cash requirements for the foreseeable future. <PAGE>NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note to the Company\'s consolidated financial statements for adiscussion of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (""SFAS"") No. ,REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME and SFAS No. , DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OFAN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION, both of which are required to be adoptedfor fiscal years beginning after December , .

MANAGEMENT\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with theaccompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for the three monthsended March , and March , . Net sales for the three months ended March , were . million, adecrease of . million (.) from the comparable period of the prior year.First quarter sales included . million of Coleman\'s sales from thecompletion of Step One of the Coleman acquisition on March , as furtherdescribed below and in Note to the condensed consolidated financialstatements. Sales for the first quarter of included approximately .million from certain divested product lines (time and temperature products andCounselorregistered trademark and Borgregistered trademark branded scales)and inventory liquidations from the Company\'s SKU rationalization program.Excluding these items, sales declined . from the first quarter of . Domestic sales (excluding Coleman), which represented approximately oftotal sales during the quarter, declined .. While domestic sales across allof the Company\'s product categories (Appliances, Personal Care & Comfort,Health at Home, Away from Home and Outdoor Cooking) fell short of due tolower price realization and unit volume declines, the majority of the salesdecline was in the Outdoor Cooking category and was as a result of lower thananticipated retail sell-through during the early stages of the retailselling season for these products. The Company initiated a million nationaladvertising campaign for Outdoor Cooking products late during the first quarterof to further stimulate retail-sell through during the remainder of theseason, including the peak mid-May to July period. To ensure the continuationof improved customer service levels during the remainder of the season, theCompany sold approximately million of Outdoor Cooking products on a ""billand hold"" basis during the first quarter. While selected point-of-sale data forOutdoor Cooking products from certain major customers in April has beengenerally favorable, it now appears unlikely that the Company will recoupcertain lost volume through incremental business generated during the remainderof the selling season. Based on the current sales outlook and existingretail inventory levels for Outdoor Cooking products, the Company nowanticipates experiencing a sales decline in this category during the secondquarter of as compared to the prior year. International sales, which represented of total revenues (excludingColeman) during the first quarter, grew . over the first quarter of .This sales growth was driven primarily by improved distribution and new productsales in Latin America, including Mexico and Venezuela, offset by declines insales of Outdoor Cooking products in Europe and Canada. The gross margin percentage for the first quarter of decreased .percentage points to .. The margin decline was primarily driven by marginerosion in the Company\'s Appliance, Health at Home and Outdoor Cookingcategories. In the Appliance and Health at Home categories, the margin erosionwas due to a decline in overall unit price realization from levels. In theOutdoor Cooking category, the gross margin decline was attributable to anadverse product sales mix, a failure to realize anticipated price realization,delays in the launch of certain higher price-point gas grills and higherinitial warranty costs on a new grill model. The adverse product sales mix wasa result of experiencing low retail sell-through of higher margin grills duringthe first quarter and a decline in sales of higher margin accessory items dueto certain lost retail placements. The Company continuously monitors future production plans at all of itsfacilities based on current inventory levels and anticipated new demand. TheCompany is currently evaluating whether to begin the second quarter season-endramp down of production at its Neosho Outdoor Cooking products facility earlierthan previously planned. If such action is taken, future operating results forthe grill season would be adversely impacted due to unabsorbed fixedfactory overhead during the second and third quarters and potentialunanticipated inventory carrying costs. The Company experienced an operating loss of . million during the firstquarter of (excluding the impact of the . million one-time specialcompensation charge described below) compared to operating earnings of .million in . This operating loss was substantially all related <PAGE>to the decline in gross margins and lower sales. First quarter selling,general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses included a one-time special chargeof . million related to new employment agreements with the Company\'sChairman and Chief Executive Officer and two other senior officers and .million related to Coleman\'s operations for March , and March , .SG&A expense excluding these items was . million, essentially even with thefirst quarter of . Lower administrative costs in were offset by higherdistribution and warehousing costs due to increased levels of inventory. Interest expense and other, net increased from . million in the firstquarter of to . million in primarily related to higher borrowinglevels in the current year for increased working capital and interest expenserelated to the Company\'s zero coupon convertible senior subordinated debenturesissued on March , at a yield to maturity that netted approximately million of proceeds to the Company as further described in Note to thecondensed consolidated financial statements. In addition, the Companyexperienced higher foreign exchange losses in the first quarter of relatedto its Mexican operations and Coleman\'s operations in Japan. The effective income tax rate benefit attributable to the operating lossfor the first quarter of is . as a result of the non-deductibility ofthe . million special compensation charge for the new employment contractsdescribed above. The Company\'s earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations,excluding the . per share special compensation charge, was a loss of .per share versus earnings per share from continuing operations in of ..In March , the Company prepaid a . million . industrial revenuebond related to its Hattiesburg facility originally due in . In connectionwith the early extinguishment of this debt, the Company recognized a .million after tax extraordinary charge (. per share) in the first quarter of. The Company\'s discontinued furniture operations, which were sold in March, had revenues of . million in the first quarter of prior to thesale and break-even earnings. The sale of the Company\'s furniture businessassets (primarily inventory, property, plant and equipment) was completed inMarch . The Company received million in cash and retained accountsreceivable related to the furniture business of approximately . million asof the closing date. The final purchase price for the furniture business wassubject to a post-closing adjustment which resulted in an additional loss ondisposal of . million, net of income tax benefits, in the first quarter of.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As further described in Note to the condensed consolidated financialstatements, on March , the Company completed the acquisition of CLNHoldings, Inc. (""CLN Holdings"") in exchange for ,, shares of theCompany\'s common stock and cash of approximately million, financed fromproceeds of the zero coupon convertible senior subordinated debenturesdiscussed above. As a result of the acquisition of CLN Holdings, the Companybecame the indirect owner of approximately . of the total number of thenoutstanding shares of The Coleman Company, Inc. The Company expects to completethe acquisition of the remaining shares of Coleman from the minorityshareholders in the summer of in exchange for approximately . millionshares of Sunbeam stock and million in cash. The Coleman acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method ofaccounting and accordingly, the condensed consolidated balance sheet at March, reflects the initial allocation of purchase price based on the fairvalue of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the condensed consolidatedstatement of operations includes the operating results for Coleman for March and March , . Cash used in operating activities during the first quarter of was. million compared to . million in the prior year. This increase isprimarily attributable to lower earnings before non-cash charges in andincreased investments in working capital, including higher accounts receivabledue <PAGE>to timing of sales during the quarter and extended payment terms under earlybuy programs and higher inventories in anticipation of increases in sales thatdid not materialize. Cash used in investing activities reflects the acquisition of CLNHoldings, net of cash acquired, of . million during the first quarter of. In , cash provided by investing activities reflected . million inproceeds from the sale of assets, businesses and product categories determinedto be non-core to the Company\'s ongoing operations. Cash provided by financing activities totaled . million in andreflects net proceeds of . million from the zero coupon convertiblesubordinated debentures, the cancellation of and repayment of all outstandingbalances under the Company\'s million September revolving creditfacility, the repayment of certain Coleman debt and the early extinguishment ofthe . million Hattiesburg bond. In addition, cash provided by financingactivities includes million of financing fees related to the Company\'s new. billion revolving and term credit facility (""New Credit Facility"") asfurther described in Note to the condensed consolidated financial statementsand million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. In April , the Company drew million of term loans under the NewCredit Facility to fund the acquisitions of Signature Brands and First Alert asfurther described in Note to the condensed consolidated financial statementsand to refinance certain debt of the acquired companies. The Company drew anadditional million of term loans and million of revolving loans in May to refinance the prepayment of certain CLN Holdings notes. In connectionwith these debt refinancings, the Company expects to record a pre-taxextraordinary charge of approximately million in the second quarter of. The Company believes its existing cash and cash equivalent balances aswell as its New Credit Facility will be sufficient to finance the completion ofthe Coleman acquisition, the restructuring and integration of Coleman,Signature Brands and First Alert into Sunbeam, and ongoing debt service andworking capital requirements for the foreseeable future.CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS Certain of the information contained herein may contain ""forward-lookingstatements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Actof , as the same may be amended from time to time (the ""Act"") and inreleases made by the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") from time totime.

In addition, the Company soldits textile mill in Biddeford, Maine in , while entering into a supplyagreement with the mill for future production of blanket shells. The Company\'s operating results for include pre-tax Restructuring andAsset Impairment Charges of . million recorded for the restructuring plan(see Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Approximately .million of these charges were paid in cash in and , primarily forseverance and other employee termination benefits, lease obligations and otherexit costs associated with facility closures. The Company estimates thatapproximately . million will be expended in the future, primarily for leaseobligations. The amounts accrued at December , , for Restructuring andAsset Impairment Charges recorded in fiscal , exceeded amounts ultimatelyrequired. Accordingly, the fiscal Consolidated Statement of Operationsreflects the reversal of accruals no longer required and resulted in aRestructuring and Asset Impairment Benefit of . million. In , in conjunction with the initiation of the restructuring plan, theCompany recorded additional charges totaling . million, reflected in Costof Sales; Selling, General and Administrative Expense (""SG&A""); and Loss onSale of Discontinued Operations. These charges related largely to inventorywrite-downs as a result of the reduction in SKU\'s, costs related to outsourcingand the divestiture of the furniture business. In , the Company incurred. million of expenses related to the restructuring effort undertaken in. These expenses were primarily for equipment movement, package redesign,employee relocation and recruiting, and an additional pre-tax loss on the saleof discontinued operations due primarily to lower than anticipated salesproceeds.

During , this inventory, a portion of which was product ofdiscontinued operations, was sold for an amount substantially equivalent to itsnet carrying value. As further described in Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements,during the fourth quarter of , the Company charged SG&A for increases of. million in environmental reserves and . million in litigationreserves. As described in Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements, theCompany also charged . million to SG&A expenses in for compensationcosts associated with restricted stock awards and other costs related to theemployment of the then new senior management team. During the first, second, third and fourth quarters of , approximately. million, . million, . million and . million, respectively, ofpre-tax liabilities provided in prior years and determined to be no longerrequired were reversed and taken into income. Included in these reserves was. million related to the litigation reserve increase in . (See Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) <PAGE> Additionally, effective in the second quarter of fiscal , the Companybegan capitalizing manufacturing supplies inventories, whereas, previouslythese inventories were charged to operations when purchased.

Due to a variety of factors, including sales in whichincreased inventory positions at certain customers, distribution losses during and other items, as discussed below, the results for are notindicative of future results. As discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources,below, and in Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the results are expected to be impacted materially by charges related to, amongother items, a provision for excess inventory, a change in management, changesin business operations resulting in part from acquisitions made in , higherinterest costs related to higher debt levels, costs associated with litigationand restructuring and asset impairment costs, as well as costs related to Year issues.YEAR ENDED DECEMBER , COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER , Net sales for were ,. million, an increase of . million or over . After excluding: (i) . million and . million in and, respectively, related to divested product lines which are not classifiedas discontinued operations (time and temperature products, decorative beddingand Counselorregistered trademark and Borgregistered trademark brandedscales), (ii) . million of sales in of discontinued inventory whichresulted primarily from the reduction of SKU\'s as part of the restructuring plan and for which the inventory carrying value was substantiallyequivalent to the sales value, and (iii) a . million benefit from thereduction of cooperative advertising accruals no longer required in (cooperative advertising costs are recorded as deductions in determining netsales), net sales on an adjusted basis (""Adjusted Sales"") increased over theprior year. Adjusted Sales, on a worldwide basis, increased during primarily fromnew product introductions, expanded distribution (particularly with theCompany\'s top ten customers), international geographic expansion and increasedinventory positions at certain customers. Adjusted Sales growth wasapproximately in the Appliance category and approximately in OutdoorCooking. In the Health at Home category, Adjusted Sales increased approximately while Adjusted Sales in the Personal Care and Comfort category decreasedapproximately during . As customers reduce inventories to normallevels, sales are expected to be adversely impacted. <PAGE> Sales increases in Appliances were driven by new products, such asre-designed blenders and mixers, coffeemakers, irons, deep fryers and toasters,and by increased distribution with large national mass retailers, combined withhigher inventory levels at certain customers. Sales of Outdoor Cooking productsincreased in attributed to increased merchandising and advertisingprograms, new distribution and higher inventory levels at certain customers.During , the Company lost a significant portion of its Outdoor Cookingproducts distribution, including the majority of its grill accessory productsdistribution. Accessories, which accounted for just over of the OutdoorCooking sales volume in , generate significantly better margins than theaverage margins on sales of grills. These distribution changes are expected toadversely impact Outdoor Cooking sales and margins in the future, until suchtime as the distribution is regained. Sales of Personal Care and Comfort products suffered during the fourthquarter of as a result of lower than expected retail sell through ofelectric blankets in key northern markets in late coupled with theinability to service demand for king and queen sized blankets due to shortagesof blanket shells. The Company has shifted to a more level production forblankets in in order to more adequately service the seasonal demand forbedding products. Health at Home category sales increased as a result of newproducts and improved distribution in the drug store channels. Both PersonalCare and Comfort and Health at Home sales were impacted by increased inventorypositions at customers in . Away from Home sales increased in as aresult of new products, including cordless clippers and titanium blades,coupled with increased distribution of commercially rated appliances. Alsocontributing to the Company\'s sales growth in were its new retail outletstores, of which were open by the end of . International sales, which represented of total revenues in , grew during the year. This sales growth was driven primarily by new voltproduct introductions and a general improvement in demand in export operationsand in Mexico. Net sales growth of approximately was achieved in the LatinAmerican export sales organization. Most of this growth came from increasedbusiness with three exporters. In Mexico and Venezuela, sales grew and ,respectively. Canada accounted for the majority of the remaining internationalsales growth. Excluding the effect of: (i) charges to cost of sales related to therestructuring plan in , (ii) the benefit of reducing reserves no longerrequired in , and (iii) the benefit in of capitalizing manufacturingsupplies inventories, gross margin as a percent of Adjusted Sales would havebeen approximately in , an improvement of approximately percentagepoints from in . This increase reflects the results of lower overheadspending, improved factory utilization and labor cost benefits resulting fromthe Company\'s restructuring plan, coupled with reductions in certain materialscosts. The lower overhead spending resulted from a reduction in the number offacilities operated by the Company. With fewer facilities used for productionpurposes, the capacity of the remaining plants was more fully utilized. Thelabor cost benefits were realized principally from shifting production toMexico. In addition, a broad based program to obtain lower costs for materialscontributed to the margin improvement. Excluding the impact of: (i) the restructuring and asset impairmentcharges to SG&A in and , (ii) the charges for the environmentalaccrual, litigation accrual, and restricted stock grant compensation, and (iii)the benefit from the reversal of reserves no longer required, SG&Aimproved to of Adjusted Sales in , down percentage points from in. This improvement was partially the result of benefits from theconsolidation of six divisional and regional headquarters into one corporateheadquarters and one administrative operations center, reduced staffing levels,a reduction in the number of warehouses, and Company-wide cost controlinitiatives. Higher expenditures in for market research, new packaging andother discretionary charges and higher bad debt expenses associated withcertain of the Company\'s customers also contributed to the decrease in SG&Acosts from to . Operating results for and , on a comparable basis as describedabove, were earnings of . million in and a loss of . million in. On the same basis, operating margin increased <PAGE> percentage points to of Adjusted Sales in versus a loss of in. This improvement resulted from the factors discussed above. Interest expense decreased from . million in to . million in primarily as a result of lower average borrowing levels in . The effective income tax rate for continuing operations was higherthan the federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to state and localtaxes plus the effect of foreign earnings taxed at other rates and the increaseto the valuation reserve for deferred tax assets, offset in part by thereversal of tax liabilities no longer required. For , the effective incometax rate for continuing operations equaled the federal statutory income taxrate. For a reconciliation of income taxes computed at the federal statutorytax rate to the amounts provided, see Note to the Consolidated FinancialStatements. The Company\'s diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was. per share in versus a loss per share from continuing operations in of .. The Company\'s share base utilized in the diluted earnings pershare calculation increased approximately during as a result of anincrease in the number of shares of common stock outstanding due to theexercise of stock options in and the inclusion of common stock equivalentsin the calculation. The Company\'s discontinued furniture business, which was sold in March, had revenues of . million in the first quarter of prior to thesale and nominal earnings. In , the discontinued furniture business had netincome of . million on revenues of . million and an estimated loss ondisposal of the business of . million, net of applicable income taxbenefits. The sale of the Company\'s furniture business assets (primarilyinventory, property, plant and equipment) was completed in March . The Company received . million in cash, retained approximately .million in accounts receivable and retained certain liabilities related to thefurniture business. The final purchase price for the furniture business wassubject to a post-closing adjustment based on the terms of the Asset PurchaseAgreement and in the first quarter of , after completion of the sale, theCompany recorded an additional loss on disposal of . million pre-tax.

Net sales in of . million represent a decrease of . million,or , from . Domestic sales represented approximately of total salesof the Company in and decreased . million or from . This salesdecline was driven by lower sales of outdoor cooking products, which declined and lower sales of bedding products which declined from , attributedprimarily to lower decorative bedding sales (divested in December ).Domestic sales of appliance products were flat with sales increases from newproducts such as vegetable steamers and toaster ovens being offset by reducedpricing on breadmakers. Sales of other product categories such as health andpersonal care products and time and temperature products (divested in March) were either flat or declined slightly from levels. The Company\'s loss from continuing operations was . million or .per share for versus earnings from continuing operations of . millionor . per share (diluted) in largely <PAGE>as a result of the restructuring activities discussed above. The net loss for was . million, or . per share, compared to net earnings of .million, or . per share (diluted), for . Excluding the impact in of the charges discussed above, operating earnings decreased from . millionin to a loss of . million in . International sales decreased . million or from primarily as aresult of lower sales in Latin America which was attributed to political andoreconomic instability in several countries such as Ecuador, Peru, Columbia andVenezuela (which suffered a Bolivar devaluation in April ), a sales declineof in Canada as a result of the bankruptcy filing of the Company\'s thenlargest Canadian customer offset by a increase in sales in Mexico as aresult of a more stable economic environment in . The Company\'s gross margin percentage, excluding the impact ofrestructuring and other charges, was of sales in , down from in, primarily from higher manufacturing costs and excess manufacturingcapacity. SG&A expenses, excluding the impact of the charges described above, were of sales in compared with of sales in . The higher expenses were due in part to higher than normal spending for market research,advertising and similar programs and higher bad debt charges associated withcertain of the company\'s customers. Operating losses, excluding the restructuring and special charges in ,were . million in , or of sales, as compared with \'s operatingearnings of . million, or of sales. The decrease in operating resultsbetween years is primarily a result of the factors discussed above. Interest expense increased from . million in to . million in as a result of increased indebtedness of the Company for working capitalrequirements and interest capitalized in related to the construction ofthe Hattiesburg manufacturing and distribution center. The effective income tax rate for equaled the federal statutoryincome tax rate. In , the effective income tax rate exceeded the federalstatutory income tax rate primarily due to state and local taxes plus theeffect of foreign earning and dividends taxes at other rates. For areconciliation of income taxes computed at the federal statutory tax rate tothe amounts provided, see Note in the Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements. The Company\'s discontinued furniture business had revenues of .million in , up from . million in . This revenue growth wasattributed primarily to the acquisition of the Samsoniteregistered trademarkfurniture business in November . Excluding the impact of this acquisition,furniture business sales declined . Earnings from the discontinued furniturebusiness, net of taxes, declined from . million in to . million in primarily as a result of lower gross margins from reduced pricing,underabsorption of higher manufacturing costs and higher raw material costs. Inaddition, SG&A costs increased due to the inclusion of the Samsoniteregisteredtrademark furniture business, higher distribution and warehousing costs,particularly with resin furniture products and higher bad debt expenses. (SeeNote to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)FOREIGN OPERATIONS During approximately of the Company\'s business was conducted inU.S. dollars (including both domestic sales, U.S. dollar denominated exportsales primarily to certain Latin American markets, Asian sales and the majorityof European sales). The Company\'s exposure to market risk from changes inforeign currency and interest rates is generally insignificant. The Company\'snon-U.S. dollar denominated sales are made principally by subsidiaries inMexico, Venezuela and Canada. Venezuela is considered a hyperinflationaryeconomy for accounting purposes for , and and Mexico reverted tohyperinflationary status for accounting purposes in ; therefore,translation adjustments related to Venezuelan and Mexican net monetary assetsare included as a component of net earnings. Such translation adjustments werenot material to , and operating results. <PAGE> On a limited basis, the Company selectively uses derivatives (foreignexchange option and forward contracts) to manage foreign exchange exposuresthat arise in the normal course of business. No derivative contracts areentered into for trading or speculative purposes. The use of derivatives didnot have a material impact on the Company\'s financial results in , and. (See Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)SEASONALITY On a consolidated basis, the Company\'s sales do not exhibit substantialseasonality; however, sales are strongest during the fourth quarter of thecalendar year. Additionally, sales of Outdoor Cooking products are strongest inthe first half of the year, while sales of Appliances and Personal Care andComfort products are strongest in the second half of the year. Furthermore,sales of a number of the Company\'s products, including warming blankets,vaporizers, humidifiers and grills may be impacted by unseasonable weatherconditions.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of December , , the Company had cash and cash equivalents of. million, working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents of .million and total debt of . million. Cash used in operating activitiesduring was . million compared to . million provided by operatingactivities in . This decrease is primarily attributable to increasedinventory levels in and spending in related to the restructuringinitiatives accrued for in , largely offset by an increase in cashgenerated by earnings in and an income tax refund (net of tax payments) in. Cash used in operating activities reflects proceeds of . million fromthe Company\'s revolving trade accounts receivable securitization programentered into in December as more fully described in Note to theConsolidated Financial Statements. The Company anticipates that cash used inoperating activities will increase during , largely from increases ininventory levels. As certain inventories built in in anticipation of sales volumes exceed the actual requirements, it will be necessary to disposeof some portions of excess inventories at amounts less than cost. The Companyexpects to continue to use the securitization program to finance a portion ofits accounts receivable. Capital spending totaled . million in and was primarily forcapacity expansion initiatives and equipment and tooling for new products andcost reduction. The new product capital spending in principally related tothe Appliance Category and included costs related to blenders, toasters,standmixers, slow cookers and a soft serve ice cream product. Capital spendingin was . million (including . million related to the discontinuedfurniture business) and was primarily attributable to equipment for new productdevelopment, cost reduction initiatives and a . million warehouse expansionfinanced with a capital lease. Capital spending in included approximately. million associated with the Hattiesburg facility, . million relatedto new product development and . million attributable to the discontinuedfurniture business. The remaining capital spending was related to costreduction projects, productivity initiatives and environmental complianceincluding . million for a powder coat paint system for Outdoor Cookingproducts. The Company anticipates capital spending to be approximately of sales and primarily related to new product introductions, capacity additionsand certain facility rationalization initiatives. Cash provided by investing activities also reflects . million inproceeds from sales of businesses, assets and product categories as part of the restructuring plan. Cash used in investing activities for includesthe purchase of a portion of the Company\'s furniture business, which wassubsequently divested in full in March . Cash provided by financing activities totaled . million in andreflects net borrowings of . million under the Company\'s revolving creditfacility, . million of debt repayments related to the divested furniturebusiness and other assets sold and . million in cash proceeds from theexercise of stock options, substantially all by former employees of theCompany. In , cash provided by financing activities of . million wasprimarily from increased revolving credit facility borrowings <PAGE>to support working capital and capital spending requirements, . million innew issuances of long-term debt and . million in proceeds from the sale oftreasury shares to certain executives of the Company. In , cash provided byfinancing activities of . million was primarily from increased revolvingcredit facility borrowings of . million, offset by . million used forthe purchase of the Company\'s common stock for treasury. In July , theCompany reduced the amount of available borrowings under its September unsecured five year revolving credit facility from million to million. In early , the Company refinanced substantially all of the thenoutstanding debt (see Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company is a party to various environmental proceedings. Substantiallyall of the environmental proceedings of the Company, before consideration ofthe acquisitions discussed below, related to previously divested operations. In, a review of environmental exposures was undertaken as a result of theCompany\'s intent to accelerate the resolution and settlement of certainenvironmental claims. This review and change in strategy resulted in additionalenvironmental reserves being recorded in as more fully described in Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In management\'s opinion, theultimate resolution of these environmental matters will not have a materialadverse effect upon the Company\'s financial condition or results of operations. On March , , the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary,acquired approximately of the total number of then outstanding shares ofcommon stock of The Coleman Company, Inc. (""Coleman""), in exchange for,, shares of the Company\'s common stock and approximately millionin cash, as well as the assumption of , million in debt. The Companyexpects to acquire the remaining equity interest in Coleman pursuant to amerger transaction for approximately . million shares of common stock andapproximately million in cash. In addition, as a result of litigationrelated to the merger consideration, the Company has entered into a memorandumof understanding (subject to court approval) pursuant to which the holders ofthe remaining equity interest in Coleman will also receive five-year warrantsto purchase . million shares of Sunbeam common stock at . per share.There can be no assurance that the court will approve the settlement asproposed. (See Part I--Significant Financial and Business Developments, Item--Legal Proceedings and Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)Coleman is a leading manufacturer and marketer of consumer products for theworldwide outdoor recreation market. Coleman\'s products have been solddomestically and internationally under the Coleman registered trademark brandname since the \'s. The Company expects to acquire the remaining equityinterest in Coleman in the first quarter of . On April , , the Company completed the cash acquisitions of FirstAlert, Inc. (""First Alert""), a leading manufacturer of smoke and carbonmonoxide detectors, and Signature Brands USA, Inc. (""Signature Brands""), aleading manufacturer of a comprehensive line of consumer and professionalproducts. The First Alert and the Signature Brands acquisitions were valued atapproximately million and million, respectively, including theassumption of debt. In order to finance the above acquisitions, and refinance substantiallyall of the indebtedness of the Company, Coleman, First Alert and SignatureBrands, the Company consummated: (i) an offering of Zero Coupon ConvertibleSenior Subordinated Debentures due (the ""Debentures"") at a yield tomaturity of (approximately , million principal amount at maturity) inMarch , which resulted in approximately million of net proceeds and,(ii) entered into a revolving and term credit facility (""New Credit Facility"")in April , which provided for an aggregate borrowing of up to . billion. In March, , the Company prepaid a . million . industrialrevenue bond related to its Hattiesburg facility originally due in . Inconnection with the early extinguishment of this debt, the Company will recorda charge of . million in the first quarter of . Also, as a result ofrepayment of certain indebtedness assumed in the Coleman acquisition, theCompany will recognize an extraordinary charge of approximately million inthe second quarter of . At June , , the Company was not in compliance with the covenants andratios under the New Credit Facility. The Company and its lenders entered intoan agreement dated June , , which <PAGE>provided that compliance with the covenants would be waived through December, . Subsequently, pursuant to an amendment dated October , , theCompany is not required to comply with the original financial covenants andratios under the New Credit Facility until April , , but will be requiredto comply with an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation andamortization covenant, the amounts of which are to be determined, beginningFebruary . At September , , following the scheduled repayment of aportion of the term loan, the New Credit Facility was reduced to , millionin total, of which approximately , million was outstanding andapproximately million was available. In addition, the Company\'s cashbalance at September , was approximately million. The Company is working closely with its bank lenders and hopes to reachagreement with the bank lenders on a further amendment to the New CreditFacility containing revised financial covenants which the bank lenders and theCompany find mutually acceptable. There can be no assurance that such anamendment, or a further waiver of the existing financial covenants, will beentered into with the bank lenders by April , . The failure to obtainsuch an amendment or further waiver would result in a violation of the existingcovenants, which would permit the bank lenders to accelerate the maturity ofall outstanding borrowings under the New Credit Facility. In December , the Company entered into a revolving trade accountsreceivable securitization program, which expires December, , to sellwithout recourse, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, certain trade accountsreceivable, up to a maximum of . million. The Company, as agent for thepurchaser of the receivables, retains collection and administrativeresponsibilities for the purchased receivables. At September , , theCompany had sold approximately . million of accounts receivable under thisprogram. At December , , standby letters of credit aggregating millionwere outstanding, primarily for insurance, environmental and workers\'compensation issues. At September , , the standby letters of creditaggregated million, including million related to an acquired company,and were predominately for insurance, pension, environmental and workers\'compensation issues. For additional information relating to the Acquisitions, Debentures andNew Credit Facility, see Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes its borrowing capacity under the New CreditAgreement, cash flow from the combined operations of the Company and itsacquired companies, existing cash and cash equivalent balances, and itsreceivable securitization program will be sufficient to support working capitalneeds, capital spending, and debt service for the foreseeable future. However,if the Company is unable to satisfactorily amend the financial covenants andratio requirements of the New Credit Facility or obtain a further waiver of theexisting covenants and ratio requirements prior to April , , the Companyexpects it would, at that time, be in default of the requirements under the NewCredit Facility and, as noted above, the lenders could then require therepayment of all amounts then outstanding under the New Credit Facility. See, also, Item , ""Legal Proceedings,"" above.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Notes and to the Company\'s consolidated financial statements fora discussion of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (""SFAS"") No. ,REPORTING COMPRESHENSIVE INCOME, SFAS No. , DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF ANENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION, SFAS No. , ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVEINSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, Statement of Position (""SOP"") -,ACCOUNTING FOR THE COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPED OR OBTAINED FORINTERNAL USE and SOP -, REPORTING ON THE COSTS OF START-UP ACTIVITIES, whichare required to be adopted for periods beginning after June , . Theadoption of these standards is not expected to <PAGE>have a material effect on the Company\'s consolidated results of operations,financial position, or cash flows, although actual charges incurred may bematerial due to Year issues, as discussed below.YEAR The Company is continuing the process of assessing the impact of the Year on its operations, including those of its subsidiaries Coleman, FirstAlert and Signature Brands which were acquired by the Company in the spring of. The Company established a Year Program Management Office in thethird quarter of to manage such continuing assessment and the design andremediation of the systems with assistance from three consulting firms. TheCompany\'s continuing assessment encompasses the Company\'s informationtechnology functions along with the impact of the effects of noncompliance byits vendors, service providers, customers, and financial institutions.Additionally, the Company is assessing the impact of noncompliance of embeddedmicroprocessors in its products as well as equipment, such as security andtelephone systems and controls for lighting, heatingventilation, and facilityaccess. The Company relies on its information technology functions to perform manytasks that are critical to its operations. Significant transactions that couldbe impacted by Year noncompliance include, among others, purchases ofmaterials, production management, order entry and fulfillment, and payrollprocessing. Systems and applications that have been identified by the Companyto date as not currently Year compliant and which are critical to theCompany\'s operations include its financial software systems, which process theorder entry, purchasing, production management, general ledger, accountsreceivable, and accounts payable functions, and critical applications in theCompany\'s manufacturing and distribution facilities, such as the warehousemanagement application. The Company plans to complete corrective work withrespect to the Company\'s systems by the second quarter of with finaltesting and implementation of such systems occurring in the third quarter of. Management believes that, although there are significant systems thatwill need to be modified or replaced, the Company\'s information systemsenvironment will be made Year compliant prior to January , . TheCompany\'s failure to timely complete such corrective work could have a materialadverse impact on the Company. The Company is not able to estimate possiblelost profits arising from such failure. The Company is in the process of contacting its vendors and suppliers ofproducts and services to determine their Year readiness and plans. Thisreview includes third party providers to whom the Company has outsourced theprocessing of its cash receipt and cash disbursement transactions and itspayroll. The Company plans to complete this review during the fourth quarter of. The failure of certain of these third party suppliers to become Year compliant could have a material adverse impact on the Company. Based on a reassessment of the Year project scope and approach, aswell as the time frame remaining to implement a solution for the Year issue, and an assessment of the requirements for operating information systemsin the Company, the current estimate of the total costs to address and remedyYear issues and to enhance the Company\'s operating systems, includingcosts for the acquired companies, is approximately million. This estimateincludes the costs of software and hardware modifications and replacements andfees to third party consultants, but excludes internal resources which are notseparately tracked by the Company with respect to the allocation of time to theYear issues. The Company expects these expenditures to be financed throughoperating cash flows or borrowings, as applicable. As of December , , theCompany had expended less than million related to new systems andremediation to address Year and other systems issues, of which themajority was for software licenses and was therefore recorded as capitalexpenditures. Of the remaining estimated expenditures, it is anticipated thatapproximately will be incurred in , with the remainder in . As theCompany continues its assessment of the Year issues and its informationrequirements to execute its business plans, the actual expenditures incurred orto be incurred may differ materially from the amounts shown above. <PAGE> As part of the assessment of the Year on its operations, the Companyplans to establish a contingency plan for addressing any effects of the Year on its operations, whether due to noncompliance of the Company\'s systemsor those of third parties. The Company expects to complete such contingencyplan by September , ; such contingency plan will address alternativeprocesses, such as manual procedures to replace those processed by noncompliantsystems, potential alternative service providers, and plans to addresscompliance issues as they arise. Subject to the nature of the systems andapplications which are not made Year compliant, the impact of suchnon-compliance on the Company\'s operations could be material if appropriatecontingency plans cannot be developed prior to January , .EFFECTS OF INFLATION For each of the three years in the period ended December , , theCompany\'s cost of raw materials and other product remained relatively stable.To the extent possible, the Company\'s objective is to offset the impact ofinflation through productivity enhancements, cost reductions and priceincreases.SUBSEQUENT EVENTS See Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements for subsequent eventsinformation relating to, among other matters, a change in management,litigation, change in fiscal year end and employment contracts entered intowith the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and other former seniorexecutives of the Company.CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS Certain statements in this Annual Report on Form -KA may constitute""forward-looking"" statements within the meaning of the Private SecuritiesLitigation Reform Act of , as the same may be amended from time to time(herein the ""Act"") and in releases made by the Securities and ExchangeCommission (""SEC"") from time to time.

MANAGEMENT\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS On June , , the Company announced that the Audit Committee of theBoard of Directors was initiating a review into the accuracy of prior financialstatements. The Audit Committee\'s review has since been completed and, as aresult of its findings, the Company has restated its previously issuedconsolidated financial statements for and and the first quarters of and (see Note to the accompanying condensed consolidated financialstatements and the Company\'s Annual Report on Form -KA for the year endedDecember , ). The following discussion should be read in conjunction withthe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for thethree months ended March , and March , .OVERVIEW On March , , the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, acquiredapproximately of the total number of then outstanding shares of common stockof The Coleman Company, Inc. (""Coleman""), in exchange for ,, shares ofthe Company\'s common stock and approximately million in cash as well as theassumption of , million in debt. The Company expects to acquire theremaining equity interest in Coleman pursuant to a merger transaction in whichthe existing Coleman minority shareholders will receive approximately .million shares of common stock and approximately million in cash. Althoughthere can be no assurance, it is anticipated the Coleman merger will occur inthe first quarter of fiscal . (See Note to the condensed consolidatedfinancial statements and Part II, Item . ""Legal Proceedings""). Coleman is aleading manufacturer and marketer of consumer products for the worldwide outdoorrecreation market. Its products have been sold domestically under the Colemanregistered trademark brand name since the \'s. The Coleman acquisition was recorded under the purchase method ofaccounting; and accordingly, the results of operations of Coleman for March and , are included in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statementof Operations. The purchase price of Coleman has been allocated to individualassets acquired and liabilities assumed based on preliminary estimates of fairmarket value at the date of acquisition. The allocation of purchase price forthe acquisition of Coleman will be revised when additional informationconcerning asset and liability valuations is obtained. Adjustments, which couldbe significant, will be made during the allocation period based on detailedreviews of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and couldresult in a substantial change in goodwill and other intangible assets. To standardize the fiscal period ends of the Company, Coleman and twocompanies acquired after March , , effective with its fiscal year,the Company has changed its fiscal year end from the Sunday nearest December to a calendar year. (See Notes and to the condensed consolidated financialstatements.)THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH , COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH , Net sales is comprised of gross sales less provisions for estimatedcustomer returns, discounts, promotional allowances, cooperative advertisingallowances and costs incurred by the Company to ship product to customers. Netsales for the three months ended March , were . million, a decreaseof . million or versus the three months ended March , . Afterexcluding: (i) . million of Coleman\'s sales for March and , , (ii)approximately million in sales resulting from the change in year enddescribed above, (iii) . million from sales relating to divested productlines which are not classified as discontinued operations (time and temperatureproducts and Counselor registered trademark and Borg registered trademarkbranded scales), and (iv) . million from sales of discontinuedinventory which resulted primarily from the reduction of SKU\'s as part of the restructuring plan and for which the inventory carrying value wassubstantially equivalent to the sales value, net sales on an adjusted basis(""Adjusted Sales"") reflected a decrease from the first quarter of .Overall, product sales were adversely impacted by price discounting andapproximately million of higher provisions for estimated returns, costs toship products to customers, rebates and other customer allowances. Domestic Adjusted Sales declined approximately million from the firstquarter of . Outdoor Cooking category sales accounted for the majority ofthis decline. During , the Company lost a significant portion of its OutdoorCooking products distribution, including the majority of its grill accessoryproducts distribution. As compared with the first quarter of , the OutdoorCooking products sales decline was also attributed to a lower than anticipatedretail sell-through during the early stages of the retail selling season.Based on the sales levels achieved in the first quarter of , distributionlosses and retail inventory levels for Outdoor Cooking products, and asignificant sales decline experienced subsequent to the first quarter ascompared with the same period in the prior year, sales for the remainder of will be significantly lower as compared to the prior year. Adjusted Sales forAppliance category products increased approximately million but were offsetby declines in other product categories, primarily Away From Home products. International sales, which represented of Adjusted Sales in the firstquarter of , grew approximately over the first quarter of \'sAdjusted Sales. This sales growth was attributed to improved distribution, newproduct sales and increased retail inventory levels in Latin America, includingMexico and Venezuela, offset by declines in sales of Outdoor Cooking products inEurope and Canada. Excluding . million of gross margin generated from the inclusion of theColeman operations for two days in the first quarter of and approximately. million in gross margin from the change in the fiscal period, gross margindeclined to . million, or . of Adjusted Sales in versus .million, or . of Adjusted Sales for the same period a year ago. The marginerosion was due to lower price realization and higher costs of customerallowances, rebates and similar incentives in , coupled with a higherproduct return reserve and an adverse product sales mix in . The adverseproduct sales mix was due in part to the loss of a majority of the grillaccessory products distribution. Accessories generate significantly bettermargins than the average margins on sales of grills. During the first quarter ofeach year, grill and grill accessory sales are traditionally a higher portion ofoverall sales in the period than during other quarters of the year. <PAGE> Due to the level of Outdoor Cooking products sales in the first quarter andthe levels of retail inventories for these products, the Company began theseason-end ramp down of production at the Neosho Outdoor Cooking productsfacility earlier than previously planned. As a result, operating results for the grill season will be adversely impacted due to unabsorbed fixed factoryoverhead during the second and third quarters and higher inventory carryingcosts. Excluding the effect of: (i) . million of selling, general andadministrative (""SG&A"") charges from Coleman, (ii) approximately . million ofSG&A expenses in from the change in the fiscal period, (iii) a . millionbenefit in the first quarter of and a . million benefit in the firstquarter of from the reversal of reserves no longer required, (iv) .million of charges recorded in related to compensation for formerexecutives, and (v) . million of restructuring related charges recorded in, SG&A expenses were higher in than . Higher distribution andwarehousing costs due to increased levels of inventory were primarilyresponsible for the increase in costs between years. Operating results for the first quarters of and , on a comparablebasis as described above, were a loss of . million in and a profit of. million in . On the same basis, operating margins as a percent ofAdjusted Sales decreased to a loss of . from a profit of . in the prioryear. This change resulted from the factors discussed above. Interest expense increased from . million in the first quarter of to . million in the first quarter of primarily related to higherborrowing levels in for the acquisitions and increased working capital.(See Note to the condensed consolidated financial statements.) Other expense, net of . million in and . million in primarily represents foreign exchange losses. Losses in both years arose fromSunbeam\'s operations in Mexico. In addition, the losses were impacted bySunbeam\'s operations in Venezuela and Coleman\'s operations in Japan. The effective income tax rate was . in the first quarter of , ascompared to . in the first quarter of . The rate is lower than thestatutory federal rate principally as a result of a valuation allowance fordeferred tax assets provided in . The rate was higher than the federalstatutory income tax rate primarily due to state and local taxes plus the effectof foreign earnings taxed at other rates. The Company\'s loss per share from continuing operations in the firstquarter of , excluding: (i) Coleman\'s results for March and , ,(ii) the effect of the change in fiscal periods, (iii) the reversals of reservesno longer required in each year\'s first quarter, (iv) the restructuring relatedcharges in , and (v) the charge related to management compensation wasa loss of . per share versus earnings per share from continuing operationsin the first quarter of of . per share. Due to increased inventorypositions at certain customers from sales in and the first quarter of ,as well as increased inventory positions at the Company, sales and operatingincome will be materially affected during the remainder of . In addition, results will be impacted materially by charges related to, among otheritems, a change in management, changes in business operations resulting in partfrom acquisitions in , interest costs associated with higher debt levels,costs associated with litigation and asset impairment costs, as well as costsrelated to Year issues. (See ""Liquidity and Capital Resources"", below, andNote to the condensed consolidated financial statements.) In March , the Company prepaid a . million . industrial revenuebond related to its Hattiesburg facility originally due in . In connectionwith the early extinguishment of this debt, the Company recognized anextraordinary charge of . million (. per share) in the first quarter of. The Company\'s discontinued furniture business, which was sold in March, had revenues of . million in the first quarter of prior to thesale and nominal earnings. As a result of the sale of the Company\'s furniturebusiness assets (primarily inventory, property, plant and equipment), theCompany received . million in cash, retained approximately . million inaccounts receivable and retained certain liabilities. The final purchase pricefor the furniture business was subject to a post-closing adjustment based on theterms of the Asset Purchase Agreement and in the first quarter of , aftercompletion of the sale, the Company recorded an additional loss on disposal of. million pre-tax.FOREIGN OPERATIONS Approximately of the Company\'s business is conducted in U.S. dollars(including both domestic sales, U.S. dollar denominated export sales, primarilyto certain Latin American markets, Asian sales and the majority of Europeansales). The Company\'s exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currencyand interest rates is generally insignificant. The Company\'s non-U.S. dollardenominated sales are made principally by subsidiaries in Mexico, Venezuela andCanada. Venezuela is considered a hyperinflationary economy for accountingpurposes for and and Mexico reverted to a hyperinflationary status foraccounting purposes in ; therefore, translation adjustments related toVenezuelan and Mexican net monetary assets are included as a component of netearnings. Mexico is not expected to be hyperinflationary at some point in . While Sunbeam\'s revenues generated in Asia have traditionally not beensignificant, economic instability in this region is expected to have a negativeeffect on Coleman\'s earnings. It is anticipated that sales in and exports tothis region will continue to decline so long as the economic environment remainsunsettled. It is not anticipated that this impact will be materially adverse tothe Company\'s results of operations taken as a whole. On a limited basis, the Company selectively uses derivatives (foreignexchange option and forward contracts) to manage foreign exchange exposures thatarise in the normal course of business. No derivative contracts are entered intofor trading or speculative purposes. The use of derivatives did not have amaterial impact on the Company\'s financial results in and . (See Note to the condensed consolidated financial statements.) <PAGE>SEASONALITY On a consolidated basis, the Company\'s sales have not traditionallyexhibited substantial seasonality; however, sales have been strongest during thefourth quarter of the calendar year. Additionally, sales of Outdoor Cookingproducts are strongest in the first half of the year, while sales of Appliancesand Personal Care and Comfort products are strongest in the second half of theyear. Furthermore, sales of a number of the Company\'s traditional products,including warming blankets, vaporizers, humidifiers and grills may be impactedby unseasonable weather conditions. After considering the seasonality of theacquired entities, the Company\'s consolidated sales are not expected to exhibitsubstantial seasonality; however, sales are expected to be strongest during thesecond quarter of the calendar year. Additionally, sales of many products soldby Coleman may be impacted by unseasonable weather conditions.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES In order to finance the acquisition of Coleman in the first quarter of and the anticipated acquisitions of First Alert, Inc. (""First Alert"") andSignature Brands USA, Inc. (""Signature Brands"") and to refinance substantiallyall of the indebtedness of the Company and the acquired entities, the Companyconsummated: (i) an offering (the ""Offering"") of Zero Coupon Convertible SeniorSubordinated Debentures due (the ""Debentures"") at a yield to maturity of (approximately , million principal amount at maturity) in March , whichresulted in approximately million of net proceeds and, (ii) entered into arevolving and term credit facility (""New Credit Facility""). (See Note .) The New Credit Facility provided for an aggregate borrowings of up to .billion pursuant to: (i) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principalamount of up to million, maturing March , ; (ii) an million termloan maturing on March , , and (iii) a million term loan maturingSeptember , . Interest accrues at a rate selected at the Company\'s optionof: (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") plus an agreed upon interestmargin which varies depending upon the Company\'s leverage ratio, as defined, andother items or, (ii) the base rate of the administrative agent (generally thehigher of the prime commercial lending rate of the administrative agent or theFederal Funds Rate plus of ), plus an agreed upon interest margin whichvaries depending upon the Company\'s leverage ratio, as defined, and other items.(See Notes and to the condensed consolidated financial statements.) As of March , , the Company had cash and cash equivalents of .million, working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents of . millionand total debt of . billion. Cash used in operating activities during thefirst quarter of was . million compared to . million in the firstquarter of . This increase is primarily attributable to lower earningsbefore non-cash charges and an increased investment in working capital. Themajority of the increase in working capital is a result of higher inventory andreceivables levels in . Inventories increased . million from December, , of which . million related to Coleman and . million relatedto Sunbeam\'s household and grill products. Receivables increased . millionfrom December , , with . million due to the Coleman acquisition and. million from Sunbeam\'s historical operating units. Extended dating termscontributed to the increase in Sunbeam\'s receivables. Cash used in operatingactivities for the first quarter reflects proceeds of . million fromthe Company\'s revolving trade accounts receivable securitization program enteredinto in December . The Company expects to continue to use the securitizationprogram to finance a portion of its accounts receivable. The Company anticipatesthat cash used in operating activities will increase in the second and thirdquarters of , principally from losses incurred in operations and increasesin inventory. As certain inventories built in and the first quarter of in anticipation of sales volumes exceed the actual requirements, it will benecessary to dispose of some portions of excess inventories at amounts less thancost. Cash used in investing activities in the first quarter of reflects. million for the acquisition of approximately of Coleman. In the firstquarter of , cash provided by investing activities reflected . millionin proceeds from the sales of divested operations. Capital spending totaled. million in and was primarily for capacity expansion initiativesprimarily at the Neosho grill manufacturing facility, and equipment and toolingfor new products. Capital spending in was . million and was primarilyattributable to manufacturing capacity expansion and equipment to manufacturenew products. The new product capital spending in principally related tothe Appliance category and included costs related to water and air filtrationproducts, blenders, standmixers and irons. The Company anticipates capitalspending to be approximately of sales, primarily related to new productintroductions, capacity additions and certain facility rationalizationinitiatives. Cash provided by financing activities totaled . million in the firstquarter of and reflects net proceeds from the Debentures of . million,the cancellation and repayment of all outstanding balances under the Company\'s million September revolving credit facility, the repayment of certainColeman debt and the early extinguishment of the . million Hattiesburg bond.In addition, cash provided by financing activities is net of . million offinancing fees related to the Company\'s . billion New Credit Facility and. million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. (See Note to thecondensed consolidated financial statements.) In April , the Company drew from the term loans under the New CreditFacility to fund the acquisitions of Signature Brands and First Alert as furtherdescribed in Note to the condensed consolidated financial statements and torefinance certain debt of the acquired companies. The Company drew an additional million of term loans and million of revolving loans in May tofinance the prepayment of certain debt assumed in connection with the Colemanacquisition. In connection with these debt refinancings, the Company expects torecord an extraordinary charge of approximately million in the secondquarter of . At June , , the Company was not in compliance with the covenants andratios under the New Credit Facility. The Company and its lenders entered intoan agreement dated June , , which provided that compliance with thecovenants would be waived through December , . Subsequently, pursuant toan amendment dated October , , the Company is not required to comply withthe original financial covenants and ratios under the New Credit Facility untilApril , , but will be required to comply with an earnings before interest,taxes, depreciation and amortization covenant, the amounts of which are to bedetermined, beginning February . At September , , following thescheduled repayment of a portion of the term loan, the New Credit Facility wasreduced to , million in total, of which approximately , million wasoutstanding and approximately million was available. In addition, theCompany\'s cash balance available for debt repayment at September , wasapproximately million. <PAGE> The Company is working closely with its bank lenders and hopes to reachagreement with the bank lenders on a further amendment to the New CreditFacility containing revised financial covenants which the bank lenders and theCompany find mutually acceptable. There can be no assurance that such anamendment, or a further waiver of the existing financial covenants, will beentered into with the bank lenders by April , . The failure to obtain suchan amendment or further waiver would result in violation of the existingcovenants, which would permit the bank lenders to accelerate the maturity of alloutstanding borrowing under the New Credit Facility. The Company expects to acquire the remaining equity interest in Colemanpursuant to a merger transaction in which the existing Coleman minorityshareholders will receive approximately . million shares of common stock andapproximately million in cash. In addition, as a result of litigationrelated to the merger consideration, the Company has entered into a memorandumof understanding (subject to court approval) pursuant to which the holders ofthe remaining equity interest in Coleman will also receive five-year warrants topurchase . million shares of Sunbeam common stock at . per share. Therecan be no assurance that the court will approve the settlement as proposed.Although there can be no assurance, it is anticipated the Coleman merger willoccur in the first quarter of fiscal . (See Note to the condensedconsolidated financial statements.) The Company believes its borrowing capacity under the New Credit Agreement,cash flow from the combined operations of the Company and its acquiredcompanies, existing cash and cash equivalent balances, and its receivablesecuritization program will be sufficient to support working capital needs,capital spending, and debt service for the foreseeable future. However, if theCompany is unable to satisfactorily amend the financial covenants and ratiorequirements of the New Credit Facility or obtain a further waiver of theexisting covenants and ratio requirements prior to April , , the Companyexpects it would, at that time, be in default of the requirements under the NewCredit Facility and, as noted above, the lenders could then require therepayment of all amounts then outstanding under the New Credit Facility.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Notes and to the Company\'s condensed consolidated financialstatements for a discussion of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards(""SFAS"") No. , DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE AND RELATEDINFORMATION, SFAS No. , ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGINGACTIVITIES, Statement of Position (""SOP"") -, ACCOUNTING FOR THE COSTS OFCOMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPED OR OBTAINED FOR INTERNAL USE and SOP -, REPORTINGON THE COSTS OF START-UP ACTIVITIES, which are required to be adopted forperiods beginning after December , . The adoption of these standards isnot expected to have a material effect on the Company\'s consolidated results ofoperations, financial position, or cash flows, although actual charges incurredmay be material due to Year issues, as discussed below.YEAR The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of the Year onits operations, including the Coleman, First Alert and Signature Brandscompanies which were acquired by the Company in the spring of . The Companyestablished a Year Program Management Office in the third quarter of to conduct such assessment with assistance from three consulting firms. TheCompany\'s assessment encompasses the Company\'s information technology functionsalong with the impact of the effects of noncompliance by its vendors, serviceproviders, customers, and financial institutions. Additionally, the Company isassessing the impact of noncompliance of embedded microprocessors in itsproducts as well as equipment, such as security and telephone systems andcontrols for lighting, heatingventilation, and facility access. The Company relies on its information technology functions to perform manytasks that are critical to its operations. Significant transactions that couldbe impacted by Year noncompliance include, among others, purchases ofmaterials, production management, order entry and fulfillment, and payrollprocessing. Systems and applications that have been identified by the Company todate as not currently Year compliant and which are critical to theCompany\'s operations include its financial software systems, which process theorder entry, purchasing, production management, general ledger, accountsreceivable, and accounts payable functions, and critical applications in theCompany\'s manufacturing and distribution facilities, such as the warehousemanagement application. The Company plans to complete corrective work withrespect to the Company\'s systems by the second quarter of with finaltesting and implementation of such systems occurring in the third quarter of. Management believes that, although there are significant systems that willneed to be modified or replaced, the Company\'s information systems environmentwill be made Year compliant prior to January , . The Company\'s failureto timely complete such corrective work could have a material adverse impact onthe Company. The Company is not able to estimate possible lost profits arisingfrom such failure. <PAGE> The Company is in the process of contacting its vendors and suppliers ofproducts and services to determine their Year readiness and plans. Thisreview includes third party providers to whom the Company has outsourced theprocessing of its cash receipt and cash disbursement transactions. The Companyplans to complete this review during the fourth quarter of . The failure ofcertain of these third party suppliers to become Year compliant could havea material adverse impact on the Company. The Company\'s preliminary assessment of the total costs to address andremedy Year issues, including costs for the acquired companies, is at least million. This estimate includes the costs of software and hardwaremodifications and replacements and fees to third party consultants, but excludesinternal resources. The Company expects these expenditures to be financedthrough operating cash flows or borrowings, as applicable. Through March ,, the Company had expended less than million related to new systems andremediation to address Year issues, of which the majority was for softwarelicenses and was therefore recorded as capital expenditures. Of the remainingestimated expenditures, it is anticipated that approximately will beincurred by year-end , with the remainder in . A significant portion ofthese expenditures will enhance the Company\'s operating systems in addition toresolving the Year issues. As the Company completes its assessment of theYear issues, the actual expenditures incurred or to be incurred may differmaterially from the amounts shown above. After completing the assessment of the Year on its operations, theCompany plans to establish a contingency plan for addressing any effects of theYear on its operations, whether due to noncompliance of the Company\'ssystems or those of third parties. The Company expects to complete suchcontingency plan by September , ; such contingency plan will addressalternative processes, such as manual procedures to replace those processed bynoncompliant systems, potential alternative service providers, and plans toaddress compliance issues as they arise. Subject to the nature of the systemsand applications which are not made Year compliant, the impact of suchnon-compliance on the Company\'s operations could be material if appropriatecontingency plans cannot be developed prior to January , .SUBSEQUENT EVENTS See Note of Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements forinformation relating to, among other matters, a change in management, litigationand anticipated asset impairment, inventory reserves and related liabilities.RESTATEMENT OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH , COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH , The results of operations previously reported for the three months endedMarch , as compared with the three months ended March , generallyunderstated the level of expenses incurred in .

OTHER INFORMATION Item ."", 'ITEM . MANAGEMENT\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTSOF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with theaccompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the threeand six months ended June , and June , .ACQUISITIONS On March , , the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, acquiredapproximately of the total number of then outstanding shares of common stockof The Coleman Company, Inc. (""Coleman""), in exchange for ,, shares ofthe Company\'s common stock and approximately million in cash as well as theassumption of , million in debt. The Company expects to acquire theremaining equity interest in Coleman pursuant to a merger transaction in whichthe existing Coleman minority shareholders will receive approximately .million shares of common stock and approximately million in cash. Althoughthere can be no assurance, it is anticipated the Coleman merger will occur inthe first half of fiscal . (See Note to the condensed consolidatedfinancial statements). Coleman is a leading manufacturer and marketer ofconsumer products for the worldwide outdoor recreation market. Its products havebeen sold domestically under the Coleman registered trademark brand name sincethe \'s. On April , , the Company completed the cash acquisitions of FirstAlert, Inc. (""First Alert""), a leading manufacturer of smoke and carbon monoxidedetectors, and Signature Brands USA, Inc. (""Signature Brands""), a leadingmanufacturer of consumer and professional products. The First Alert and theSignature Brands acquisitions were valued at approximately million and million, respectively, including the assumption of debt. The acquisitions were recorded under the purchase method of accounting; andaccordingly, the results of operations of each acquired entity are included inthe accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations from therespective dates of acquisition. The purchase prices of the acquired entitieshave been allocated to individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed basedon preliminary estimates of fair market values at the dates of acquisition. Thepurchase price allocations for the acquisitions will be revised when additionalinformation concerning asset and liability valuations is obtained. Adjustments,which could be significant, will be made during the allocation periods based ondetailed reviews of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumedand could result in a substantial change in goodwill and other intangibleassets. To standardize the fiscal period ends of the Company and the acquiredentities, effective with its fiscal year, the Company has changed itsfiscal year end from the Sunday nearest December to a calendar year. (SeeNote to the condensed consolidated financial statements.)THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE , COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE , Results of operations for the three months ended June , include theresults of Coleman for the entire period and of Signature Brands and First Alertfrom the date of acquisition. The acquired entities generated net sales of. million in the quarter with corresponding gross margin of . million,or . of sales. SG&A costs recorded by the acquired entities were .million in the period, yielding an operating profit of . million. Included incost of sales of the acquired entities for the quarter was approximately million of expense related to purchase accounting adjustments which requireadjusting the values of acquired inventories to fair market value at the date ofacquisition. Accordingly, as these inventories are sold, the purchase accountingadjustments related to these inventories (in this case, increases in inventoryvalues) are reflected in cost of sales. A year ago, for the full quarter, thesebusinesses generated sales approximately . million higher than in the secondquarter of . The majority of this sales decrease occurred at Coleman wheresales were impacted by fewer product lines resulting from the sale of a portionof the business, exiting the pressure washer business during , and a programin to reduce SKU\'s. Softness in demand resulting from the domestic retailchannel\'s efforts to lower inventory levels and adverse economic conditions inJapan and Southeast Asia also impacted Coleman\'s sales as compared with thesecond quarter of the prior year. Additionally, each acquired businessexperienced a general disruption due to the acquisitions and management changes.As compared with a year ago, Signature Brands sales were adversely affected byproduct availability issues. Excluding the impact of the purchase accountingadjustments described above, gross margin generated by the acquired entities was. million lower in than for the same quarter in . The lower salesat Coleman and Signature Brands accounted for approximately of this change,while the remainder was principally due to a change in sales mix of SignatureBrands products and charges related primarily to excess and obsolete inventory. <PAGE> In and the first half of , the Company built inventories inanticipation of sales volumes which have not materialized. Inventory onhand at June , , before consideration of allowances and inventories ofacquired entities, was nearly double the amount at the end of the second quarterof . As a result, it has been and will continue to be necessary to disposeof some portions of this excess inventory at amounts less than cost.Accordingly, in the second quarter of , the Company recorded . millionin charges to properly state this inventory at lower-of-cost-or-market. Of thischarge, a nominal amount related to an acquired entity. The Company alsorecorded a charge of . million for excess inventories for raw materials andwork in process which will not be used due to outsourcing the production of therelated products. Additionally, the Company decided to discontinue certainproduct lines in the second quarter of and, accordingly, recorded a chargeof . million to properly state this inventory at lower-of-cost-or-market.Approximately of this charge related to the recently developed air and waterfiltration products and certain grill products. In the second quarter of , as a result of decisions to outsource ordiscontinue a substantial number of products previously made by the Company,certain facilities and equipment will either no longer be used or will be usedin a significantly different manner. Accordingly, a charge of . million wasrecorded to write certain of these assets down to reflect the fair market valueof items held for disposition. Approximately of this charge related tomachinery, equipment and tooling at the Company\'s Mexico City and Hattiesburg,Mississippi manufacturing plants. Personnel at the Mexico City facility werenotified in the second quarter of that the plant is scheduled for closureat year-end , accordingly, a liability of . million was recorded in costof goods sold primarily for employee severance and other facility closure costs.The Company is in the process of assessing the impairment of certain otherassets to be retained by the Company which will be used in a significantlydifferent manner as a result of the decisions to outsource or discontinuecertain products. Additionally, the Company is in the process of assessing theexpected future performance of its business operations. These assessments areexpected to be completed in the fourth quarter and are expected to result inmaterial adjustments to the valuation of assets used in the business. Net sales as reported by Sunbeam is comprised of gross sales lessprovisions for estimated customer returns, discounts, promotional allowances,cooperative advertising allowances and costs incurred by the Company to shipproduct to customers. Net sales for the three months ended June , were. million, an increase of . million versus the three months ended June, . After excluding: (i) . million from sales generated by theacquired entities, as discussed above, and (ii) . million from sales forsales of discontinued inventory (which resulted primarily from the reduction ofSKU\'s as part of the restructuring plan and for which the inventorycarrying value was substantially equivalent to the sales value) and a benefitfrom the reduction of cooperative advertising accruals no longer required in, net sales on an adjusted basis (""Adjusted Sales"") were . million in, a decrease from . million in the second quarter of . Overall,Adjusted Sales for the second quarter of were adversely impacted byincreased inventory positions at customers from sales made during and thefirst quarter of . In addition, the historical Sunbeam operations wereadversely impacted by disruption from acquisition activities and managementchanges in the period. Domestic Adjusted Sales declined approximately million from the secondquarter of . The Company believes nearly all of this decline wasattributable to declining retail inventory levels in the quarter as comparedwith increasing levels in the same quarter of . Based on the Company\'sanalyses, inventory positions at customers began increasing in the secondquarter of , with significant growth occurring in the third and fourthquarters of . In the first quarter of , it is believed retail inventorylevels of the Company\'s products continued to increase, although not as markedlyas in either of the last two quarters of . Overall, the Company believesdomestic retail inventory positions of the Company\'s products increased nearly million from the second quarter of through the first quarter of .In the second quarter of , these inventories are believed to have beenreduced by approximately . International sales, which represented of Adjusted Sales in the secondquarter of , decreased approximately compared with the second quarter of\'s Adjusted Sales. This sales decline, which arose primarily in LatinAmerica and Canada, is believed to be due in part to decreasing customerinventory levels as compared with the prior year. In addition, sales in LatinAmerica were adversely impacted by lower sales to certain export distributorsand by poor economic conditions. In Canada, sales were adversely impacted by aloss of certain grill distribution. Excluding: (i) the gross margin generated from the inclusion of theacquired entities\' operations in the quarter, as discussed above; (ii) thecharges in the second quarter of related to excess inventory and fixedassets, as discussed above; (iii) a . million benefit in of reducing thecooperative advertising accrual no longer required, and (iv) a . millionbenefit recorded in the second quarter of resulting from capitalizingmanufacturing supplies inventories which were previously expensed, gross margindeclined to a loss of . million for the second quarter of versus aprofit of . million for the same period a year ago. The decline in salesbetween years contributed to the decline in gross margin dollars generated.Gross margin was also adversely affected by price discounting, overall lowermarket prices on breadmakers and an adverse product sales mix in . Theadverse product sales mix was due in part to the loss of a majority of the grillparts and accessories products distribution. Parts and accessories generatesignificantly better margins than the average margins on sales of grills. Duringthe second quarter of each year, grill and grill parts and accessories sales aretraditionally a higher portion of overall sales than during other quarters ofthe year. Due to the level of Outdoor Cooking products sales in the quarter andthe level of on-hand inventories, the Company began the season-end ramp down ofproduction at the Neosho Outdoor Cooking products facility earlier thanpreviously planned. This ramp down in manufacturing, along with costs associatedwith a blanket recall, and certain adjustments related to physical inventoriesdrove the remaining <PAGE>increases in cost of goods sold in the quarter. Operating results will beadversely impacted due to higher inventory carrying costs and unabsorbed fixedfactory overhead during the remainder of the year. Excluding the effect of: (i) . million of SG&A expense incurred by theacquired entities; (ii) approximately . million of benefit in the secondquarter of from the reversal of deferred compensation charges recorded inthe first quarter; (iii) a . million benefit in the second quarter of and . million in from the reversal of reserves no longer required, and(iv) . million of restructuring related charges recorded in , SG&Aexpenses were . million in , double the amount for the same period in. Advertising and marketing costs were million higher in than in, due to a national television advertising campaign for grills, packageredesign costs, market research and the acceleration of advertising spending inthe year as compared with . Higher inventory levels in and costsassociated with outsourcing small parts fulfillment led to higher distributionand warehousing costs which were million greater than in the same period of. Corporate administrative costs were million higher between years,resulting primarily from increases in outside service provider fees, travel andrelocation fees, and other general administrative costs. Higher bad debt chargesas compared with the prior year accounted for the majority of the remainingincrease in SG&A costs between years. These bad debt charges resulted nearlyequally from collection issues with certain customers in the US and in LatinAmerica. Operating results for the second quarters of and , on an adjustedbasis as described above, were a loss of . million in and a profit of. million in . This change resulted from the factors discussed above. Interest expense increased from . million in the second quarter of to . million in the second quarter of primarily related to higherborrowing levels in for the acquisitions and funding for increased workingcapital and operating losses. (See Note to the condensed consolidatedfinancial statements.) Other expense, net in of . million and . million in primarily represents foreign exchange losses, principally from Sunbeam\'soperations in Mexico, Venezuela and Canada. The minority interest reported for the second quarter of relates tothe minority interest held in Coleman by public shareholders. Income taxes in the second quarter of reflect foreign taxes andfranchise taxes. A valuation allowance has been provided in for deferredtax assets generated by Sunbeam\'s operations. The rate was higher than thefederal statutory income tax rate primarily due to state and local taxes plusthe effect of foreign earnings taxed at other rates. Due to increased inventory positions at certain customers which resultedfrom sales in and the first quarter of , as well as increased inventorypositions at the Company, sales and operating income will be materially affectedduring the remainder of and into . In addition, results will beimpacted materially by charges related to, among other items, a change inmanagement, changes in business operations resulting in part from acquisitionsin , interest costs associated with higher debt levels, costs associatedwith litigation and asset impairment costs, as well as costs related to Year issues. (See ""Liquidity and Capital Resources"", below, and Notes , , , and to the condensed consolidated financial statements.) In the second quarter of , the Company prepaid certain debt assumed inthe acquisitions. In connection with the early extinguishment of this debt, theCompany recognized an extraordinary charge of . million (. per share).SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE , COMPARED TO SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE , Results of operations for the six months ended June , include theresults of Coleman for March and , and the entire second quarter andof Signature Brands and First Alert from April , . The acquired entitiesgenerated net sales of . million in the period since the acquisitions withcorresponding gross margin of . million, or . of sales. SG&A costsrecorded by the acquired entities were . million in the period, yielding anoperating profit of . million. Included in cost of sales of the acquiredentities was approximately million of expense related to purchase accountingadjustments which require adjusting the values of acquired inventories to fairmarket value at the date of acquisition. Accordingly, as these inventories aresold, the purchase accounting adjustments related to these inventories (in thiscase, increases in inventory values) are reflected in cost of sales. A year ago,on a year-to-date basis, these acquired entities generated sales approximately million higher than for the current year-to-date. The majority of thisdecrease occurred at Coleman where sales were impacted by fewer product linesresulting from the sale of a portion of the business, exiting the pressurewasher business during , and a program in to reduce SKU\'s. Softness indemand resulting from the domestic retail channel\'s efforts to lower inventorylevels and adverse economic conditions in Japan and Southeast Asia also impactedColeman\'s sales as compared with the first half of the prior year. Additionally,each acquired business experienced a general disruption due to the acquisitionsand management changes. The remaining sales decline between years was fromSignature Brands where sales were adversely affected by product availabilityissues. Excluding the impact of the purchase accounting adjustments, asdescribed above, gross margins generated by the acquired entities were .million lower in the first half of as compared to the same period in theprior year. The lower sales at Coleman and Signature Brands accounted forapproximately of this change, while the remainder was principally due to achange in the sales mix of Signature Brands products, increases in productreturns at First Alert and charges related primarily to excess and obsoleteinventory. <PAGE> Net sales for the six months ended June , were . million, anincrease of . million versus the six months ended June , . Afterexcluding: (i) . million of sales generated by the acquired entities, asdiscussed above; (ii) approximately million of higher sales in resultingfrom the change in fiscal year end, as described in Note to the condensedconsolidated financial statements; (iii) . million from sales ofdiscontinued inventory which resulted primarily from the reduction of SKU\'s aspart of the restructuring plan and for which the inventory carrying valuewas substantially equivalent to the sales value; (iv) . million from sales relating to divested product lines which are not classified asdiscontinued operations (time and temperature products and Counselor registered trademark and Borg registered trademark branded scales), and (v) a. million benefit from the reduction of cooperative advertising accruals nolonger required in , net sales on an adjusted basis (""Adjusted Sales"") of. million were down approximately from . million in the first halfof . Overall, product sales were adversely impacted by decreasing inventorypositions at customers, price discounting and higher provisions for estimatedreturns, costs to ship products to customers, rebates and other customerallowances. Domestic Adjusted Sales declined approximately million from the firsthalf of . Nearly all of this decline was from the Outdoor Cooking andAppliance categories, with the majority of the change due to Outdoor Cooking.During , the Company lost a significant portion of its Outdoor Cookingproducts distribution, including the majority of its grill parts and accessoriesproducts distribution. The Outdoor Cooking products sales decline wasattributable to this lost distribution, to high levels of retail inventory fromsales in the fourth quarter of , to price discounting and higher customerallowances. The Company believes the decline in sales in the Appliance categoryresulted primarily from increasing retail inventory levels for the first sixmonths of as compared with decreasing levels in . International sales, which represented of Adjusted Sales in the firsthalf of , decreased approximately compared with the first half of \'sAdjusted Sales. This sales decline was attributable primarily to changes incustomer inventory levels, lower sales to certain export distributors, grilldistribution losses in Canada, and by poor economic conditions in Latin America. Excluding: (i) the gross margin generated from the inclusion of theacquired entities\' operations in the period, as discussed above; (ii) the impactof the change in fiscal year-end as discussed in Note to the condensedconsolidated financial statements; (iii) the charges in the second quarter of related to excess inventory and fixed assets, as discussed above; (iv) .million from the benefit in of reducing the cooperative advertising accrualno longer required, and (v) a . million benefit recorded in the secondquarter of resulting from capitalizing manufacturing supplies inventorieswhich were previously expensed, gross margin declined to . million for thefirst half of versus . million for the same period a year ago.Approximately half of the decrease is attributable to lower price realizationand higher costs of customer allowances, rebates and similar incentives in ,higher product return reserves and an adverse product sales mix in . Theadverse product sales mix was due in part to the loss of a majority of the grillparts and accessories products distribution. Parts and accessories generatesignificantly better margins than the average margins on sales of grills. Duringthe first half of each year, grill and grill parts and accessories sales aretraditionally a higher portion of overall sales than during the last half of theyear. Lower sales volume, unfavorable manufacturing efficiencies from lowerproduction levels, along with costs associated with a blanket recall, andcertain adjustments related to physical inventories drove the majority of theremaining increases in cost of good sold in the period. Excluding the effect of: (i) . million of SG&A charges in the acquiredentities; (ii) approximately . million of SG&A expense in from thechange in the fiscal period; (iii) a . million benefit in the first half of and a . million benefit in the same period in from the reversal ofreserves no longer required; (iv) . million of charges recorded in related to compensation for former executives, and (v) . million ofrestructuring related charges recorded in , SG&A expenses were .million in , higher than the same period in . Nearly all of thisincrease between years occurred in the second quarter and is explained in thecomparison of results in the second quarter, above. Operating results for the first halves of and , on an adjustedbasis as described above, were a loss of . million in and a profit of. million in . This change resulted from the factors discussed above. Interest expense increased from . million in the first half of to. million in the first half of . Nearly all of the change related tohigher borrowing levels in for the acquisitions and increased funding forworking capital and the operating losses. (See Note to the condensedconsolidated financial statements.) Other expense, net in of . million and . million in primarily represents foreign exchange losses, principally from Sunbeam\'soperations in Mexico, Venezuela and Canada. The minority interest reported in relates to the minority interestheld in Coleman by public shareholders. Income taxes in reflect foreign taxes and franchise taxes. A valuationallowance has been provided in for deferred tax assets generated bySunbeam\'s operations. The rate was higher than the federal statutory incometax rate primarily due to state and local taxes plus the effect of foreignearnings taxed at other rates. <PAGE> In , the Company prepaid certain debt assumed in the acquisitions andprepaid an industrial revenue bond related to its Hattiesburg facility. Inconnection with the early extinguishment of this debt, the Company recognized anextraordinary charge of . million (. per share). The Company\'s discontinued furniture business, which was sold in March, had revenues of . million in the first quarter of prior to thesale and nominal earnings for that period. As a result of the sale of theCompany\'s furniture business assets (primarily inventory, property, plant andequipment), the Company received . million in cash, retained approximately. million in accounts receivable and retained certain liabilities. The finalpurchase price for the furniture business was subject to a post-closingadjustment based on the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement and in the firstquarter of , after completion of the sale, the Company recorded anadditional loss on disposal of . million pre-tax.FOREIGN OPERATIONS Approximately of the Company\'s business is conducted in U.S. dollars(including both domestic sales, U.S. dollar denominated export sales, primarilyto certain Latin American markets, Asian sales and the majority of Europeansales). The Company\'s non-U.S. dollar denominated sales are made principally bysubsidiaries in Europe, Japan and Mexico. Mexico reverted to a hyperinflationarystatus for accounting purposes in ; therefore, translation adjustmentsrelated to Mexican net monetary assets are included as a component of netearnings. Mexico is not expected to be considered hyperinflationary as ofJanuary , . While Sunbeam\'s revenues generated in Asia have traditionally not beensignificant, economic instability in this region is expected to have a negativeeffect on Coleman\'s earnings. Economic instability and the political environmentin Latin America have also affected sales in that region. It is anticipated thatsales in and exports to these regions will continue to decline so long as theeconomic environments in those regions remain unsettled. On a limited basis, the Company selectively uses derivatives (foreignexchange option and forward contracts) to manage foreign exchange exposures thatarise in the normal course of business. No derivative contracts are entered intofor trading or speculative purposes. The use of derivatives did not have amaterial impact on the Company\'s financial results in and . (See Note to the condensed consolidated financial statements.)SEASONALITY On a consolidated basis, the Company\'s sales have not traditionallyexhibited substantial seasonality; however, sales have been strongest during thefourth quarter of the calendar year. Additionally, sales of Outdoor Cookingproducts are strongest in the first half of the year, while sales of Appliancesand Personal Care and Comfort products are strongest in the second half of theyear. Furthermore, sales of a number of the Company\'s traditional products,including warming blankets, vaporizers, humidifiers and grills may be impactedby unseasonable weather conditions. After considering the seasonality of theacquired entities, the Company\'s consolidated sales are not expected to exhibitsubstantial seasonality; however, sales are expected to be strongest during thesecond quarter of the calendar year. Additionally, sales of many products soldby the Company may be impacted by unseasonable weather conditions.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES In order to finance the acquisitions of Coleman, First Alert and SignatureBrands and to refinance substantially all of the indebtedness of the Company andthe acquired entities, the Company consummated: (i) an offering (the ""Offering"")of Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Subordinated Debentures due (the""Debentures"") at a yield to maturity of (approximately , millionprincipal amount at maturity) in March , which resulted in approximately million of net proceeds and, (ii) entered into a revolving and term creditfacility (""New Credit Facility""). The Company was required to file a registration statement with theSecurities and Exchange Commission to register the Debentures by June , ,which registration statement has not been filed. From June , until theday on which the registration statement is filed and declared effective, theCompany is required to pay to the Debenture holders cash liquidated damagesaccruing, for each day during such period, at a rate per annum equal to .during the first days and . thereafter multiplied by the total of theissue price of the Debentures plus the original issue discount thereon on suchday. The Company made its first payment of approximately , to theDebenture holders on September , . (See Note ) The New Credit Facility provided for aggregate borrowings of up to .billion pursuant to: (i) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principalamount of up to million, maturing March , ; (ii) an million termloan maturing on March , , and (iii) a million term loan maturingSeptember , . Interest accrues at a rate selected at the Company\'s optionof: (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") plus an agreed upon interestmargin which varies depending upon the Company\'s leverage ratio, as defined, andother items or, (ii) the base rate of the administrative agent (generally thehigher of the prime commercial lending rate of the administrative agent or theFederal Funds Rate plus of ), plus an agreed upon interest margin whichvaries depending upon the Company\'s leverage ratio, as defined, and other items.The New Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including limitations on theability of the Company and its subsidiaries to engage in certain transactionsand the requirement to maintain certain financial covenants and ratios. <PAGE> At June , , the Company was not in compliance with the financialcovenants and ratios required under the New Credit Facility. The Company and itslenders entered into an agreement dated June , , which provided thatcompliance with the covenants would be waived through December , .Borrowings under the New Credit Facility are secured by the Company\'s assets,including its stock interest in Coleman. Pursuant to an amendment dated October, , the Company is not required to comply with the original financialcovenants and ratios under the New Credit Facility until April , , butwill be required to comply with an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciationand amortization covenant, the amounts of which are to be determined, beginningFebruary . Concurrent with each of these amendments, interest margin wasincreased. The margin continues to increase monthly through March to amaximum of basis points over LIBOR. At the end of November , followingthe scheduled repayment of a portion of the term loan, the New Credit Facilitywas reduced to , million in total, of which approximately , millionwas outstanding and approximately million was available. In addition, atthe same time, the Company\'s cash balance available for debt repayment wasapproximately million. The Company is working closely with its bank lenders in an effort to reachagreement on a further amendment to the New Credit Facility containing mutuallyacceptable revised financial covenants. There can be no assurance that such anamendment, or a further waiver of the existing financial covenants, will beentered into with the bank lenders by April , . The failure to obtain suchan amendment or further waiver would result in violation of the existingcovenants, which would permit the bank lenders to accelerate the maturity of alloutstanding borrowings under the New Credit Facility. Accordingly, the debtrelated to the New Credit Facility and all debt containing cross-defaultprovisions is classified as current in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheetas of June , . At June , , the Company had cash and cash equivalents of. million. Cash used in operating activities during the first half of was . million compared to . million in the first half of . Thisincrease is primarily attributable to lower earnings before non-cash charges andan increased investment in working capital. The majority of the increase inworking capital is a result of higher inventory levels in . Inventoriesincreased . million from December , , before consideration of the. million inventory reserve taken in the second quarter. This increasereflects . million of inventory acquired in the acquisitions, less a .million decrease in the acquired entities\' inventories after acquisition, and. million in higher inventory related to Sunbeam\'s household and grillproducts. Cash used in operating activities for the first half reflectsproceeds of . million from the Company\'s revolving trade accounts receivablesecuritization program entered into in December . Including the effect ofthe receivables securitization program, receivables increased . millionfrom year-end , reflecting . million in acquired receivables, and .million, net, of increases in receivables from acquired entities partiallyoffset by decreases in the levels of receivables held by Sunbeam at December ,. The Company expects to continue to use the securitization program tofinance a portion of its accounts receivable. Also contributing to the increasein working capital was a decrease of . million in accounts payable,excluding acquired payables. The Company anticipates using cash for operatingactivities in the remainder of the year, principally for losses incurred inoperations, although this anticipated use of cash is not expected to be assignificant as was incurred in the second quarter. Cash used in investing activities in the first half of reflects .million for the acquisitions. In the first half of , cash provided byinvesting activities reflected . million in proceeds from the sales ofdivested operations and other assets. Capital spending totaled . million in and was primarily for several manufacturing efficiency initiatives,equipment and tooling for new products and management information systemshardware and software licenses. The new product capital spending principallyrelated to the air and water products which were discontinued in the secondquarter, grills and appliances, including irons, blenders and standmixers. Asthe Company completes its assessment of expected future performance of itsbusiness operations, valuation adjustments may be required for certain of theassets acquired in . Capital spending in was . million and wasprimarily attributable to manufacturing capacity expansion and equipment tomanufacture new products. The Company anticipates capital spending to beapproximately of sales, primarily related to new product introductions andmanufacturing efficiency initiatives including rationalization of certainfacilities. Cash provided by financing activities totaled . million in the firsthalf of and reflects net proceeds from the Debentures of . million,the cancellation and repayment of all outstanding balances under the Company\'s million September revolving credit facility, the repayment of certaindebt acquired with the acquisitions and the early extinguishment of the .million Hattiesburg industrial revenue bond. In addition, cash provided byfinancing activities includes . million of proceeds from the exercise ofstock options. (See Note to the condensed consolidated financial statements.) The Company expects to acquire the remaining equity interest in Colemanpursuant to a merger transaction in which the existing Coleman minorityshareholders will receive approximately . million shares of common stock andapproximately million in cash. In addition, as a result of litigationrelated to the merger consideration, the Company has entered into a memorandumof understanding (subject to court approval) pursuant to which the holders ofthe remaining equity interest in Coleman will also receive five-year warrants topurchase . million shares of Sunbeam common stock at . per share. Therecan be no assurance that the court will approve the settlement as proposed.Although there can be no assurance, it is anticipated the Coleman merger willoccur in the first half of fiscal . (See Note to the condensedconsolidated financial statements.) <PAGE> The Company believes its borrowing capacity under the New Credit Agreement,cash flow from the combined operations of the Company and its acquiredcompanies, existing cash and cash equivalent balances, and its receivablesecuritization program will be sufficient to support working capital needs,capital spending, and debt service for the foreseeable future. However, if theCompany is unable to satisfactorily amend the financial covenants and ratiorequirements of the New Credit Facility or obtain a further waiver of theexisting covenants and ratio requirements prior to April , , the Companyexpects it would, at that time, be in default of the requirements under the NewCredit Facility and, as noted above, the lenders could then require therepayment of all amounts then outstanding under the New Credit Facility.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note to the Company\'s condensed consolidated financial statements fora discussion of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (""SFAS"") No. ,DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION, SFAS No., ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, Statement ofPosition (""SOP"") -, ACCOUNTING FOR THE COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPEDOR OBTAINED FOR INTERNAL USE and SOP -, REPORTING ON THE COSTS OF START-UPACTIVITIES, which are required to be adopted for periods beginning afterDecember , . The adoption of these standards is not expected to have amaterial effect on the Company\'s consolidated results of operations, financialposition, or cash flows, although actual charges incurred may be material due toYear issues, as discussed below.YEAR READINESS DISCLOSURE AND OPERATING SYSTEMS ENHANCEMENTS The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of the Year onits operations, including the Coleman, First Alert and Signature Brandscompanies which were acquired by the Company in the spring of . The Companyestablished a Year Program Management Office in the third quarter of to conduct such assessment with assistance from three consulting firms. TheCompany\'s assessment encompasses the Company\'s information technology functionsalong with the impact of the effects of noncompliance by its vendors, serviceproviders, customers, and financial institutions. The assessment of theCompany\'s information technology functions is substantially complete.Additionally, the Company is assessing the impact of noncompliance of embeddedmicroprocessors in its products as well as equipment, such as manufacturingequipment, security and telephone systems and controls for lighting,heatingventilation, and facility access. The Company relies on its information technology functions to perform manytasks that are critical to its operations. Significant transactions that couldbe impacted by Year noncompliance include, among others, purchases ofmaterials, production management, order entry and fulfillment, and payrollprocessing. Systems and applications that have been identified by the Company todate as not currently Year compliant and which are critical to theCompany\'s operations include its financial software systems, which process theorder entry, purchasing, production management, general ledger, accountsreceivable, and accounts payable functions, and critical applications in theCompany\'s manufacturing and distribution facilities, such as the warehousemanagement application. The Company plans to complete corrective work withrespect to the Company\'s systems by the second quarter of with finaltesting and implementation of such systems occurring in the second and thirdquarters of . Management believes that, although there are significantsystems that will need to be modified or replaced, the Company\'s informationsystems environment will be made Year compliant prior to January , .The Company\'s failure to timely complete such corrective work could have amaterial adverse impact on the Company. The Company is not able to estimatepossible lost profits arising from such failure. The Company is in the process of contacting its vendors and suppliers ofproducts and services to determine their Year readiness and plans. Thisreview includes third party providers to whom the Company has outsourced theprocessing of its cash receipt and cash disbursement transactions. The Companyplans to complete this review during the first quarter of . The failure ofcertain of these third party suppliers to become Year compliant could havea material adverse impact on the Company. The Company\'s preliminary assessment of the total costs to address andremedy Year issues and enhance its operating systems, including costs forthe acquired companies, is million. This estimate includes the costs ofsoftware and hardware modifications and replacements and fees to third partyconsultants, but excludes internal resources. The Company expects theseexpenditures to be financed through operating cash flows or borrowings, asapplicable. Through June , , the Company had expended approximately million related to new systems and remediation to address Year issues, ofwhich the majority was recorded as capital expenditures. Of the total costs, itis anticipated that approximately to will be incurred by year-end ,with the remainder in . A significant portion of these expenditures willenhance the Company\'s operating systems in addition to resolving the Year issues. As the Company completes its assessment of the Year issues, theactual expenditures incurred or to be incurred may differ materially from theamounts shown above. After completing the assessment of the Year on its operations, theCompany plans to establish a contingency plan for addressing any effects of theYear on its operations, whether due to noncompliance of the Company\'ssystems or those of third parties. The Company expects to complete suchcontingency plan by September , ; such contingency plan will <PAGE>address alternative processes, such as manual procedures to replace thoseprocessed by noncompliant systems, potential alternative service providers, andplans to address compliance issues as they arise. Subject to the nature of thesystems and applications which are not made Year compliant, the impact ofsuch non-compliance on the Company\'s operations could be material if appropriatecontingency plans cannot be developed prior to January , .OTHER MATTERS See Notes , , and of Notes to the condensed consolidated financialstatements for information relating to, among other matters, litigation,financing and potential asset impairment issues.RESTATEMENT OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE , COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE , The results of operations previously reported for the three months endedJune , as compared with the three months ended June , generallyoverstated sales in and understated the level of expenses incurred in thatyear.

MANAGEMENT\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanyingcondensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and ninemonths ended September , and September , .ACQUISITIONS On March , , the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, acquiredapproximately of the total number of then outstanding shares of common stockof The Coleman Company, Inc. (""Coleman""), in exchange for ,, shares ofthe Company\'s common stock and approximately million in cash as well as theassumption of , million in debt. The Company expects to acquire theremaining equity interest in Coleman pursuant to a merger transaction in whichthe existing Coleman minority shareholders will receive approximately .million shares of common stock and approximately million in cash. Althoughthere can be no assurance, it is anticipated the Coleman merger will occur inthe first half of fiscal . (See Note to the condensed consolidatedfinancial statements.) Coleman is a leading manufacturer and marketer ofconsumer products for the worldwide outdoor recreation market. Its products havebeen sold domestically under the Coleman registered trademark brand name sincethe \'s. On April , , the Company completed the cash acquisitions of FirstAlert, Inc. (""First Alert""), a leading manufacturer of smoke and carbon monoxidedetectors, and Signature Brands USA, Inc. (""Signature Brands""), a leadingmanufacturer of consumer and professional products. The First Alert and theSignature Brands acquisitions were valued at approximately million and million, respectively, including the assumption of debt. The acquisitions were recorded under the purchase method of accounting; andaccordingly, the results of operations of each acquired entity are included inthe accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations from therespective dates of acquisition. The purchase prices of the acquired entitieshave been allocated to individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed basedon preliminary estimates of fair market values at the dates of acquisition. Thepurchase price allocations for the acquisitions will be revised when additionalinformation concerning asset and liability valuations is obtained. Adjustments,which could be significant, will be made during the allocation periods based ondetailed reviews of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumedand could result in a substantial change in goodwill and other intangibleassets. To standardize the fiscal period ends of the Company and the acquiredentities, effective with its fiscal year, the Company has changed itsfiscal year end from the Sunday nearest December to a calendar year. (SeeNote to the condensed consolidated financial statements.)THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER , COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER, Results of operations for the three months ended September , includethe results of the acquired entities for the entire period. The acquiredentities generated net sales of . million in the quarter with correspondinggross margin of . million, or of sales. SG&A costs recorded by theacquired entities were . million in the period, yielding an operating lossof . million. Included in cost of sales of the acquired entities for thequarter was approximately million of expense related to purchase accountingadjustments which require adjusting the values of acquired inventories to fairmarket value at the date of acquisition. Accordingly, as these inventories aresold, the purchase accounting adjustments related to these inventories (in thiscase, increases in inventory values) are reflected in cost of sales. A year ago,for the full quarter, these businesses generated sales approximately millionhigher than occurred in the third quarter of . The majority of this decreaseoccurred at Coleman where sales were impacted by fewer product lines resultingfrom the sale of a portion of the business and exiting the pressure washerbusiness during . First Alert sales were adversely impacted by higherreturns, as compared with the same period a year ago. Additionally, eachacquired business experienced a general disruption due to the acquisitions andmanagement changes. Excluding the impact of the purchase accounting adjustmentsdescribed above, gross margins in the acquired entities were million lowerin as compared with their results in the prior year. Lower sales in theacquired entities accounted for approximately of this change. Colemanrecorded . million in third quarter charges for excess and obsolete inventoryand a provision for fixed assets, as described in Note to the condensedconsolidated financial statements. In addition, an adverse sales mix atSignature Brands and recent developments on existing environmental remediationat Coleman which resulted in an increase in the environmental provisionaccounted for the majority of the remaining decrease in margins as compared withthose reported by the acquired entities a year ago. <PAGE> Net sales as reported by Sunbeam is comprised of gross sales less provisionsfor estimated customer returns, discounts, promotional allowances, cooperativeadvertising allowances and costs incurred by the Company to ship product tocustomers. Net sales for the three months ended September , were .million, an increase of . million versus the three months ended September, . After excluding: (i) . million from sales generated by theacquired entities, as discussed above; (ii) approximately million from sales related to the change in fiscal period, as discussed in Note to thecondensed consolidated financial statements, and (iii) . million from and . million from sales of excess or discontinued inventory for whichthe inventory carrying value was substantially equivalent to the sales value,net sales on an adjusted basis (""Adjusted Sales"") were . million in , a decrease from . million in the third quarter of . Overall, AdjustedSales for the third quarter of as compared with the prior year wereadversely impacted by increasing retail inventory positions in as comparedwith decreasing retail inventory positions in , distribution losses andsales timing issues. In addition, the historical Sunbeam operations wereadversely impacted by disruption from acquisition activities and managementchanges in the period. Domestic Adjusted Sales declined approximately million from the thirdquarter of . The Company believes approximately half of the decline in salesbetween years was attributable to the changes in retail inventory positions.Excluding the impact of the change in retail inventories between periods, thedecline in sales was attributable to lower sales levels throughout the business.The single largest component of this decrease in sales was attributable totiming issues related to sales of Personal Care and Comfort products. Thisdecrease as compared with a year ago is expected to be largely recovered in thefourth quarter. Appliance product sales were adversely impacted by significantprice reductions for breadmakers. Distribution losses for grills, appliances andHealth at Home products accounted for the majority of the remaining salesdecrease as compared with last year\'s third quarter. International sales, which represented of Adjusted Sales in the thirdquarter of , were just over half the level achieved in the third quarter of\'s Adjusted Sales. The Company believes this sales decline was due to threekey reasons: decreasing customer inventory levels as compared with the prioryear; a decision to stop selling to certain Latin American export distributors,and poor economic conditions in Latin America. Excluding: (i) the gross margin generated from the inclusion of the acquiredentities\' operations in the quarter, as discussed above, and (ii) the impact in of the change in the fiscal period, as discussed in Note to the condensedconsolidated financial statements, gross margin declined to a loss of .million for the third quarter of versus a profit of . million for thesame period a year ago. The decrease in sales volume between periods, coupledwith adverse manufacturing variances and increases in estimated warrantyreserves accounted for the majority of the decrease in margins. The adversemanufacturing variances as compared with the third quarter of arose fromlower manufacturing activities in the current year resulting from the highlevels of inventory on hand and a less robust demand forecast than existed ayear ago. Operating results will be adversely impacted due to higher inventorycarrying costs and unabsorbed fixed factory overhead during the remainder of theyear. Excluding the effect of: (i) . million of SG&A charges from the acquiredentities; (ii) million related to warrants issued in the period, asdiscussed in Note to the condensed consolidated financial statements; (iii)approximately . million of costs due to the change in fiscal periods; (iii). million of costs incurred in related to the restatement efforts andrelated litigation, Year remediation and costs of relocating the corporateoffice; (iv) . million in for severance and other costs resulting fromthe change in management, net of the reversal of certain compensation costsrecorded in the first quarter as discussed in Note to the condensedconsolidated financial statements; (v) . million of benefit in the thirdquarter of from the reversal of reserves no longer required, including therestructuring reserve reversal, as shown in Note to the condensed consolidatedfinancial statements; and (vi) . million of restructuring related chargesrecorded in , SG&A expenses were . million in , approximately higher than the same period in . Higher freight and warehousing costsresulting from the higher inventory levels in along with higher costsrelated to customer service resulted in nearly million of the increase incosts between years. Increases in required legal and environmental reserves ledto approximately million higher costs between years. Travel and relocation,higher outside service costs and other general SG&A cost increases between yearsaccount for the remaining change. Operating results for the third quarters of and , on an adjustedbasis as described above, were a loss of . million in and a profit of. million in . This change resulted from the factors discussed above. Interest expense increased from . million in the third quarter of to. million in the third quarter of primarily related to higher borrowinglevels in for the acquisitions. (See Note to the condensed consolidatedfinancial statements.) Other income, net in of . million included approximately millionfrom the settlement of a lawsuit. The remaining other income, net in andthe . million recognized in were from favorable foreign exchange,primarily from Mexico. The minority interest reported for the third quarter of relates to theminority interest held in Coleman by public shareholders. <PAGE> Income taxes in the third quarter of reflect taxes benefits on earningsof foreign operations. A valuation allowance has been provided in fordeferred tax assets generated by Sunbeam\'s operations. The rate was higherthan the federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to state and localtaxes plus the effect of foreign earnings taxed at other rates. Due to increased inventory positions at certain customers which resultedfrom sales in and the first quarter of , as well as increased inventorypositions at the Company, sales and operating income will be affected in thefourth quarter of and into . Future results are also expected to beimpacted materially by charges related to, among other items, changes inbusiness operations resulting in part from acquisitions in , interest costsassociated with higher debt levels, asset impairment costs, as well as costsrelated to Year issues. (See ""Liquidity and Capital Resources"", below, andNotes , , , and to the condensed consolidated financial statements.)NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER , COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER, Results of operations for the nine months ended September , includethe results of Coleman for March and , and the entire second and thirdquarters and of Signature Brands and First Alert from April , . Theacquired entities generated net sales of . million in the period since theacquisitions with corresponding gross margin of . million, or of sales.SG&A costs recorded by the acquired entities were . million in the period,yielding an operating loss of . million. Included in cost of sales of theacquired entities was approximately million of expense related to purchaseaccounting adjustments which require adjusting the values of acquiredinventories to fair market value at the date of acquisition. Accordingly, asthese inventories are sold, the purchase accounting adjustments related to theseinventories (in this case, increases in inventory values) are reflected in costof sales. A year ago, on a year-to-date basis, sales of the acquired entitieswere approximately million higher than in the comparable nine months of due to: a decrease in product lines at Coleman resulting from the sale of aportion of the business, a program to reduce SKU\'s and exiting the pressurewasher business in ; softness in demand resulting from the domestic retailchannel\'s efforts to lower inventory levels; adverse economic conditions inJapan and Southeast Asia; product availability issues at Signature Brands;higher sales returns at First Alert, and general disruption in the acquiredentities due to the acquisitions and management changes. Excluding the impact ofthe purchase accounting adjustments described above, gross margins generated bythe acquired entities were million lower in than for the prioryear-to-date period. Approximately of the change resulted from the lowersales in . An adverse sales mix at Signature Brands and charges at Colemanand Signature Brands in related to inventory reserves, provisions for fixedassets and environmental remediation accounted for the majority of the remainingdecline in margins as compared with operations in the acquired entities for thefirst nine months of . Net sales for the nine months ended September , were ,.million, an increase of . million versus the nine months ended September, . After excluding: (i) . million of sales generated by the acquiredentities, as discussed above; (ii) approximately million of higher sales in resulting from the change in fiscal year end, as described in Note to thecondensed consolidated financial statements; (iii) . million in and. million from sales of excess or discontinued inventory for which theinventory carrying value was substantially equivalent to the sales value; (iv). million from sales relating to divested product lines which are notclassified as discontinued operations (time and temperature products andCounselor registered trademark and Borg registered trademark brandedscales), and (v) a . million benefit from the reduction of cooperativeadvertising accruals no longer required in , net sales on an adjusted basis(""Adjusted Sales"") of . million decreased approximately from .million in the first nine months of . Overall, product sales were adverselyimpacted by changes in retail inventory levels, price discounting and higherprovisions for estimated returns, costs to ship products to customers, rebatesand other customer allowances. Domestic Adjusted Sales declined approximately or million from thefirst three quarters of . The Company believes more than half of the salesdecline was due to increasing retail inventory levels in versus decreasinginventory positions at customers in . Excluding this effect, sales werestill lower than the prior year throughout the business, with the mostsignificant decline occurring in Outdoor Cooking products sales. During ,the Company lost a significant portion of its Outdoor Cooking productsdistribution, including the majority of its grill parts and accessories productsdistribution. The Outdoor Cooking products sales decline was attributable tothis lost distribution, to price discounting and higher customer allowances.Appliance Adjusted Sales declined between years as a result of higher provisionsfor returns, freight and co-operative advertising allowances in , lostdistribution and price erosion on breadmakers. The sales decline in PersonalCare and Comfort products arose principally in the third quarter and wasprimarily due to sales timing issues which are generally expected to berecovered in the fourth quarter. International sales, which represented of Adjusted Sales for the firstthree quarters of , decreased approximately compared with the AdjustedSales for the same period a year ago. The Company believes this sales declinewas primarily attributable to decreasing customer inventory levels as comparedwith the prior year. Sales were also adversely impacted by a decision to stopselling to certain export distributors in Latin America and by poor economicconditions in that region. In addition, lost distribution in Canada contributedto the sales decline from the prior year. <PAGE> Excluding: (i) the gross margin generated from the inclusion of the acquiredentities\' operations in the period, as discussed above; (ii) the impact of thechange in fiscal year-end as discussed in Note to the condensed consolidatedfinancial statements; (iii) . million in charges recorded in the secondquarter of related to excess inventory and fixed assets; (iii) . millionfrom the benefit in of reducing the cooperative advertising accrual nolonger required, and (iv) a . million benefit recorded in the second quarterof resulting from capitalizing certain manufacturing supplies inventorieswhich were previously expensed, gross margin declined to a loss of . millionfor the first nine months of versus . million for the same period ayear ago. Lower sales volume and unfavorable manufacturing efficiencies fromlower production levels associated with the lower sales volumes and highinventory levels in accounted for approximately of the change betweenyears. Approximately of the decrease is attributable to lower pricerealization and higher costs of customer allowances, rebates and similarincentives in , higher product return reserves and an adverse product salesmix in . The adverse product sales mix was due in part to the loss of amajority of the grill accessory products distribution. Accessories generatesignificantly better margins than the average margins on sales of grills. Duringthe first half of each year, grill and grill accessory sales are traditionally ahigher portion of overall sales in the period than during other quarters of theyear. Costs associated with a blanket recall, higher warranty reserves andcertain adjustments related to physical inventories drove the remainingincreases in cost of goods sold. Excluding the effect of: (i) . million of SG&A charges in the acquiredentities; (ii) million recorded in the second quarter of related to theissuance of warrants; (iii) approximately . million of SG&A expense in from the change in the fiscal period; (iv) a . million benefit in the firstnine months of and an . million benefit in the same period in fromthe reversal of reserves no longer required; (v) . million of chargesrecorded in related to compensation and severance for certain formeremployees; (vi) . million of costs incurred in related to therestatement efforts, Year remediation and the corporate office relocation,and (vii) . million of restructuring related charges recorded in , SG&Aexpenses were . million in , higher than the same period in .This increase is due in part to approximately million in higher advertisingand marketing costs between years due to a national television advertisingcampaign for grills, package redesign costs and market research. Higherinventory levels in and costs associated with outsourcing small partsfulfillment led to higher distribution and warehousing costs which were million greater than a year ago. Corporate administrative costs wereapproximately million higher between years, resulting primarily fromincreases in outside service provider fees, including telephone charges, traveland relocation fees, higher legal and environmental reserves and other generaladministrative costs. Higher bad debt charges in accounted for the majorityof the remaining increase in SG&A costs between years. These bad debt chargesresulted nearly equally from collection issues with certain customers in theU.S. and in Latin America. Operating results for the first three quarters of and , on anadjusted basis as described above, were a loss of . million in and aprofit of . million in . This change resulted from the factors discussedabove. Interest expense increased from . million in the first nine months of to . million for the same period in . Approximately of thechange related to higher borrowing levels in for the acquisitions, with theremainder due to increased borrowings to fund working capital and the operatinglosses. (See Note to the condensed consolidated financial statements.) Other income, in net of . million included approximately millionfrom the settlement of a lawsuit. Excluding this amount, there was approximately. million of net losses from foreign exchange in the period. In , netforeign exchange gains accounted for the majority of the . million otherincome. The foreign exchange gains and losses in each year are primarily fromresults in Mexico. The minority interest reported in relates to the minority interest heldin Coleman by public shareholders. Income taxes in reflect taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries andfranchise taxes. A valuation allowance has been provided in for deferredtax assets generated by Sunbeam\'s operations. The rate was higher than thefederal statutory income tax rate primarily due to state and local taxes plusthe effect of foreign earnings taxed at other rates. In , the Company prepaid certain debt assumed in the acquisitions andprepaid an industrial revenue bond related to its Hattiesburg facility. Inconnection with the early extinguishment of this debt, the Company recognized anextraordinary charge of . million (. per share). The Company\'s discontinued furniture business, which was sold in March ,had revenues of . million in the first quarter of prior to the sale andnominal earnings for that period. As a result of the sale of the Company\'sfurniture business assets (primarily inventory, property, plant and equipment),the Company received . million in cash, retained approximately . millionin accounts receivable and retained certain liabilities. The final purchaseprice for the furniture business was subject to a post-closing adjustment basedon the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement and in the first quarter of ,after completion of the sale, the Company recorded an additional loss ondisposal of . million pre-tax. <PAGE>FOREIGN OPERATIONS Approximately of the Company\'s business is conducted in U.S. dollars(including both domestic sales, U.S. dollar denominated export sales, primarilyto certain Latin American markets, Asian sales and the majority of Europeansales). The Company\'s non-U.S. dollar denominated sales are made principally bysubsidiaries in Europe, Japan and Mexico. Mexico reverted to a hyperinflationarystatus for accounting purposes in ; therefore, translation adjustmentsrelated to Mexican net monetary assets are included as a component of netearnings. Mexico is not expected to be considered hyperinflationary as ofJanuary , . While Sunbeam\'s revenues generated in Asia have traditionally not beensignificant, economic instability in this region is expected to have a negativeeffect on Coleman\'s earnings. Economic instability and the political environmentin Latin America have also affected sales in that region. It is anticipated thatsales in and exports to these regions will continue to decline so long as theeconomic environments in those regions remain unsettled. On a limited basis, the Company selectively uses derivatives (foreignexchange option and forward contracts) to manage foreign exchange exposures thatarise in the normal course of business. No derivative contracts are entered intofor trading or speculative purposes. The use of derivatives did not have amaterial impact on the Company\'s financial results in and . (See Note to the condensed consolidated financial statements.)SEASONALITY On a consolidated basis, the Company\'s sales have not traditionallyexhibited substantial seasonality; however, sales have been strongest during thefourth quarter of the calendar year. Additionally, sales of Outdoor Cookingproducts are strongest in the first half of the year, while sales of Appliancesand Personal Care and Comfort products are strongest in the second half of theyear. Furthermore, sales of a number of the Company\'s traditional products,including warming blankets, vaporizers, humidifiers and grills may be impactedby unseasonable weather conditions. After considering the seasonality of theacquired entities, the Company\'s consolidated sales are not expected to exhibitsubstantial seasonality; however, sales are expected to be strongest during thesecond quarter of the calendar year. Additionally, sales of many products soldby the Company may be impacted by unseasonable weather conditions.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES In order to finance the acquisition of Coleman, First Alert and SignatureBrands and to refinance substantially all of the indebtedness of the Company andthe acquired entities, the Company consummated: (i) an offering (the ""Offering"")of Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Subordinated Debentures due (the""Debentures"") at a yield to maturity of (approximately , millionprincipal amount at maturity) in March , which resulted in approximately million of net proceeds and, (ii) entered into a revolving and term creditfacility (""New Credit Facility""). The Company was required to file a registration statement with theSecurities and Exchange Commission to register the Debentures by June , ,which registration statement has not been filed. From June , until theday on which the registration statement is filed and declared effective, theCompany is required to pay to the Debenture holders cash liquidated damagesaccruing, for each day during such period, at a rate per annum equal to .during the first days and . thereafter multiplied by the total of theissue price of the Debentures plus the original issue discount thereon on suchday. The Company made its first payment of approximately , to theDebenture holders on September , . (See Note .) The New Credit Facility provided for aggregate borrowings of up to .billion pursuant to: (i) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principalamount of up to million, maturing March , ; (ii) an million termloan maturing on March , , and (iii) a million term loan maturingSeptember , . Interest accrues at a rate selected at the Company\'s optionof: (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") plus an agreed upon interestmargin which varies depending upon the Company\'s leverage ratio, as defined, andother items or, (ii) the base rate of the administrative agent (generally thehigher of the prime commercial lending rate of the administrative agent or theFederal Funds Rate plus of ), plus an agreed upon interest margin whichvaries depending upon thE Company\'s leverage ratio, as defined, and other items.The New Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including limitations on theability of the Company and its subsidiaries to engage in certain transactionsand the requirement to maintain certain financial covenants and ratios. At June , , the Company was not in compliance with the financialcovenants and ratios required under the New Credit Facility. The Company and itslenders entered into an agreement dated June , , which provided thatcompliance with the covenants would be waived through December , .Borrowings under the New Credit Facility are secured by the Company\'s assets,including its stock interest in Coleman. Pursuant to an amendment dated October, , the Company is not required to comply with the original financialcovenants and ratios under the New Credit Facility until April , , butwill be required to comply with an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciationand amortization covenant, the amounts of which are to be determined, beginningFebruary . Concurrent with each of these amendments, interest margin wasincreased. The <PAGE>margin continues to increase monthly through March to a maximum of basis points over LIBOR. At the end of November , following the scheduledrepayment of a portion of the term loan, the New Credit Facility was reduced to, million in total, of which approximately , million was outstandingand approximately million was available. In addition, at the same time, theCompany\'s cash balance available for debt repayment was approximately million. The Company is working closely with its bank lenders in an effort to reachagreement on a further amendment to the New Credit Facility containing mutuallyacceptable revised financial covenants. There can be no assurance that such anamendment, or a further waiver of the existing financial covenants, will beentered into with the bank lenders by April , . The failure to obtain suchan amendment or further waiver would result in violation of the existingcovenants, which would permit the bank lenders to accelerate the maturity of alloutstanding borrowings under the New Credit Facility. Accordingly, the debtrelated to the New Credit Facility and all debt containing cross-defaultprovisions is classified as current in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheetas of September , . At September , , the Company had cash and cash equivalents of. million. Cash used in operating activities during the first three quartersof was . million compared to . million for the same period in. This increase is attributable to lower earnings before non-cash charges.Year-to-date , . million in cash was generated by reducing receivablesand a similar amount was used as inventories increased. The majority of thiscash generation was from Coleman as that operation reduced receivables balancesgenerated in its peak second quarter period. The remaining cash usage forworking capital resulted primarily from reducing accounts payable levels. Cash used in investing activities in the first nine months of reflects. million for the acquisitions. In the first three quarters of , cashprovided by investing activities reflected . million in proceeds from thesales of divested operations and other assets. Capital spending totaled .million in and was primarily for manufacturing efficiency initiatives,equipment and tooling for new products, and management information systemshardware and software licenses. The new product capital spending principallyrelated to the air and water filtration products which were discontinued in thesecond quarter, electric blankets, grills, clippers and appliances. As theCompany completes its assessment of expected future performance of its businessoperations, valuation adjustments may be required for certain of the assetsacquired in . Capital spending in was . million and was primarilyattributable to manufacturing capacity expansion, cost reduction initiatives andequipment to manufacture new products. The Company anticipates capitalspending to be approximately of sales, primarily related to new productintroductions, capacity additions and certain facility rationalizationinitiatives. Cash provided by financing activities totaled . million in the firstnine months of and reflects net proceeds from the Debentures of .million, the cancellation and repayment of all outstanding balances under theCompany\'s million September revolving credit facility, the repaymentof certain debt acquired with the acquisitions and the early extinguishment ofthe . million Hattiesburg industrial revenue bond. In addition, cashprovided by financing activities includes . million of proceeds from theexercise of stock options. (See Note to the condensed consolidated financialstatements.) The Company expects to acquire the remaining equity interest in Colemanpursuant to a merger transaction in which the existing Coleman minorityshareholders will receive approximately . million shares of common stock andapproximately million in cash. In addition, as a result of litigationrelated to the merger consideration, the Company has entered into a memorandumof understanding (subject to court approval) pursuant to which the holders ofthe remaining equity interest in Coleman will also receive five-year warrants topurchase . million shares of Sunbeam common stock at . per share. Therecan be no assurance that the court will approve the settlement as proposed.Although there can be no assurance, it is anticipated the Coleman merger willoccur in the first half of fiscal . (See Note to the condensedconsolidated financial statements.) The Company believes its borrowing capacity under the New Credit Agreement,cash flow from the combined operations of the Company and its acquiredcompanies, existing cash and cash equivalent balances, and its receivablesecuritization program will be sufficient to support working capital needs,capital spending, and debt service for the foreseeable future. However, if theCompany is unable to satisfactorily amend the financial covenants and ratiorequirements of the New Credit Facility or obtain a further waiver of theexisting covenants and ratio requirements prior to April , , the Companyexpects it would, at that time, be in default of the requirements under the NewCredit Facility and, as noted above, the lenders could then require therepayment of all amounts then outstanding under the New Credit Facility.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note to the Company\'s condensed consolidated financial statements fora discussion of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (""SFAS"") No. ,DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION, SFAS No., ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, Statement ofPosition (""SOP"") -, ACCOUNTING FOR THE COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPEDOR OBTAINED FOR INTERNAL USE and SOP -, REPORTING ON THE COSTS OF START-UPACTIVITIES, which are <PAGE>required to be adopted for periods beginning after December , . Theadoption of these standards is not expected to have a material effect on theCompany\'s consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows,although actual charges incurred may be material due to Year issues, asdiscussed below.YEAR READINESS DISCLOSURE AND OPERATING SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of the Year onits operations, including the Coleman, First Alert and Signature Brandscompanies which were acquired by the Company in the spring of . The Companyestablished a Year Program Management Office in the third quarter of to conduct such assessment with assistance from three consulting firms. TheCompany\'s assessment encompasses the Company\'s information technology functionsalong with the impact of the effects of noncompliance by its vendors, serviceproviders, customers, and financial institutions. The assessment of theCompany\'s information technology functions is substantially complete.Additionally, the Company is assessing the impact of noncompliance of embeddedmicroprocessors in its products as well as equipment, such as manufacturingequipment, security and telephone systems and controls for lighting,heatingventilation, and facility access. The Company relies on its information technology functions to perform manytasks that are critical to its operations. Significant transactions that couldbe impacted by Year noncompliance include, among others, purchases ofmaterials, production management, order entry and fulfillment, and payrollprocessing. Systems and applications that have been identified by the Company todate as not currently Year compliant and which are critical to theCompany\'s operations include its financial software systems, which process theorder entry, purchasing, production management, general ledger, accountsreceivable, and accounts payable functions, and critical applications in theCompany\'s manufacturing and distribution facilities, such as the warehousemanagement application. The Company plans to complete corrective work withrespect to the Company\'s systems by the second quarter of with finaltesting and implementation of such systems occurring in the second and thirdquarters of . Management believes that, although there are significantsystems that will need to be modified or replaced, the Company\'s informationsystems environment will be made Year compliant prior to January , .The Company\'s failure to timely complete such corrective work could have amaterial adverse impact on the Company. The Company is not able to estimatepossible lost profits arising from such failure. The Company is in the process of contacting its vendors and suppliers ofproducts and services to determine their Year readiness and plans. Thisreview includes third party providers to whom the Company has outsourced theprocessing of its cash receipt and cash disbursement transactions. The Companyplans to complete this review during the first quarter of . The failure ofcertain of these third party suppliers to become Year compliant could havea material adverse impact on the Company. The Company\'s preliminary assessment of the total costs to addressand remedy Year issues and enhance its operating systems, including costsfor the acquired companies, is million. This estimate includes the costs ofsoftware and hardware modifications and replacements and fees to third partyconsultants, but excludes internal resources. The Company expects theseexpenditures to be financed through operating cash flows or borrowings, asapplicable. Through September , , the Company had expended approximately million related to new systems and remediation to address Year issuesof which approximately half was recorded as capital expenditures. Of the totalcosts, it is anticipated that approximately to will be incurred byyear-end , with the remainder in . A significant portion of theseexpenditures will enhance the Company\'s operating systems in addition toresolving the Year issues. As the Company completes its assessment of theYear issues, the actual expenditures incurred or to be incurred may differmaterially from the amounts shown above.

MANAGEMENT\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ACQUISITIONS On March , , the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary,acquired approximately of the total number of then outstanding shares ofcommon stock of Coleman from an affiliate of M&F, in exchange for ,,shares of the Company\'s common stock and approximately million in cash. Inaddition, the Company assumed approximately , million in debt. Immediatelythereafter, as a result of the exercise of employee stock options, Sunbeam\'sindirect beneficial ownership of Coleman decreased to approximately of thetotal number of the outstanding shares of Coleman common stock. The Company\'sagreement for the acquisition of the remaining publicly held Coleman sharespursuant to a merger transaction provides that the remaining Colemanshareholders will receive approximately . million shares of Sunbeam commonstock (. share for each outstanding Coleman share) and approximately million in cash (. for each outstanding Coleman share and a cash-out ofunexercised Coleman options equal to the difference between . per share andthe exercise price of such options. The Company expects to complete the Colemanmerger during the second half of , although there can be no assurance thatthe merger will occur during that time. See Notes and of Notes toConsolidated Financial Statements and Item - ""Significant Financial andBusiness Developments - Settlement of Coleman-Related Claims"" for informationregarding the settlement of certain claims relating to the Coleman acquisition,the terms of which involved the issuance of warrants to purchase shares of theCompany\'s common stock at . per share. On April , , the Company completed the cash acquisitions of FirstAlert, a leading manufacturer of smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, andSignature Brands, a leading manufacturer of consumer and professional products.The First Alert and the Signature Brands acquisitions were valued atapproximately million (including million of cash and million ofassumed debt) and million (reflecting cash paid, including the requiredretirement or defeasance of debt), respectively. The acquisitions were recorded under the purchase method of accountingand accordingly, the financial position and results of operations of eachacquired entity are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from therespective dates of acquisition. The purchase prices of the acquired entitieshave been allocated to individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed basedon estimates of fair values (determined by independent appraisals) at the datesof acquisition.FISCAL YEAR To standardize the fiscal period ends of the Company and the acquiredentities, effective with its fiscal year, the Company has changed itsfiscal year end from the Sunday nearest December to a calendar year. (SeeNote of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)ASSET IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER CHARGESGOODWILL When changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value ofgoodwill may not be recoverable, the Company estimates future cash flows usingthe recoverability method (undiscounted future cash flows and including relatedinterest charges) as a basis for recording any impairment loss. An impairmentloss is then recorded to adjust the carrying value of goodwill to therecoverable amount. The impairment loss taken is no greater than the amount bywhich the carrying value of the net assets of the business exceeds its fairvalue. Due to First Alert\'s financial performance in and its prospects in and beyond, the Company determined that the goodwill relating to thisacquisition was impaired. Accordingly, based on its determination of fair value,the Company has written off the net carrying value of goodwill of . millionin the fourth quarter of .FIXED ASSET IMPAIRMENT AND EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY RESERVES In the second quarter of , the Company decided to outsource ordiscontinue a substantial number of products previously made by the Company,resulting in certain facilities and equipment that will either no longer be usedor will be utilized in a significantly different manner. Accordingly, a chargeof . million was recorded in Cost of Goods Sold to write certain of theseassets down to their estimated fair market market value. Approximately ofthis charge related to machinery, equipment and tooling at the Company\'s MexicoCity and Hattiesburg, Mississippi manufacturing plants, the estimated fair valuefor which was derived through an auction process. The remainder of this chargerelated to tooling and equipment at various other facilities, which either had anominal value or the fair market value of which was derived through <PAGE>an auction process. These assets were taken out of service at the time of thewrite-down and consequently were not depreciated further after the write-down. Personnel at the Mexico City facility were notified in the secondquarter of that the plant was scheduled for closure at year-end ,accordingly, at that time a liability of . million was recorded in Cost ofGoods Sold primarily for employee severance. The employee severance related toapproximately , positions of which approximately , were terminated as ofDecember , . In the third quarter of , the Company recorded in Cost ofGoods Sold an additional provision for impairment of fixed assets of .million in an acquired entity relating to assets taken out of service for whichthere was no remaining value. The asset impairment resulted from management\'sdecision to discontinue certain product lines subsequent to the acquisition.These fixed assets were taken out of service at the time of the write-down andconsequently were not depreciated further after the write-down. In the fourthquarter of , the Company recorded a . million charge as a result ofmanagement\'s decision to outsource the production of certain appliances. Thischarge to Cost of Goods Sold primarily consists of a provision for certaintooling and equipment (. million) and severance and related benefits (.million). The tooling and equipment was written down to its estimated fair valuewhich was derived from comparable market data. This equipment was taken out ofservice and depreciation of this equipment was discontinued at the time of thewrite-down. During and the first half of , the Company built inventoriesin anticipation of sales volumes which did not materialize. As a result, ithas been and will continue to be necessary to dispose of some portions of excessinventories at amounts less than cost. Accordingly, during , when the factsand circumstances were known that such sales volume would not materialize, theCompany recorded . million in charges to properly state this inventory atthe lower-of-cost-or-market. This inventory primarily related to certainappliances, grills and grill accessories. The Company also recorded a charge of. million for excess inventories for raw materials and work in process whichwill not be used due to outsourcing the production of irons, breadmakers,toasters and certain other appliances. In addition, during , the Companymade the decision to exit certain product lines, primarily air and waterfiltration products and eliminate certain stock keeping units (""SKU\'S"") withinexisting product lines, primarily relating to appliances, grills and grillaccessories. As a result of this decision, a . million charge was recordedto properly state this inventory at the lower-of-cost-or-market. Total chargesfor excess inventories recorded at the lower-of-cost-or-market amounted toapproximately . million at December , . (See Note of Notes toConsolidated Financial Statements for asset impairment and other chargesrecorded in conjunction with a restructuring plan.)RESTATEMENTS On June , , Sunbeam announced that the Audit Committee wasinitiating a review into the accuracy of Sunbeam\'s prior financial statements.The Audit Committee\'s review has since been completed and, as a result of itsfindings, Sunbeam has restated its previously issued consolidated financialstatements for and and the first quarter of . Based upon thereview, it was determined that certain revenue had been inappropriatelyrecognized, certain costs and allowances had not been accrued or were improperlyrecorded, and certain costs were inappropriately included in, and subsequentlycharged to, restructuring, asset impairment and other costs within theConsolidated Statement of Operations for the years ended December , andDecember , and the three months ended March , . The financialstatements for the years ended December , and December , wereaudited and filed on Form -KA with the SEC on November , . Theaccompanying Consolidated Financial Statements present the restated results. In connection with the restatements referred to above, the Company wasadvised by Arthur Andersen that there existed conditions that Arthur Andersenbelieved to be material weaknesses in the Company\'s internal control. See Item - - ""Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and FinancialDisclosure"". In order to address these material weaknesses, the Company hasincreased the number of senior financial personnel and has implementedcomprehensive review procedures of operating and financial information.Additionally, as explained in more detail under ""Year Readiness Disclosure""within Item , the Company is in the process of significantly enhancing itsoperating systems. The Company anticipates that its systems enhancements will becompleted in .YEAR ENDED DECEMBER , COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER , Results of operations for the year ended December , include theresults of Coleman from March , and of Signature Brands and First Alertfrom April , , the respective dates of the acquisition. The acquiredentities generated net sales of ,. million from the acquisition datesnoted above through December , , with corresponding gross margin of .million, or of sales. SG&A costs recorded by the acquired entities were. million in the period, yielding an operating loss of . million. <PAGE> For the acquired entities, net sales from the dates of the acquisitionsthrough fiscal year-end were approximately million lower than the sales forthe same period in the prior year. This decline was caused by lower net sales atColeman (. million), Signature Brands (. million) and First Alert (.million). Excluding the effects of Coleman\'s sale of its safety and securitybusiness in March and the discontinuation of its pressure washer businessduring , Coleman\'s sales would have been approximately million lowerthan in . The Company believes that Signature Brands\' decline, primarily inits coffee and tea products, resulted largely from lost distribution andinsufficient attention to the business during part of . The Company believesthat all of the acquired businesses were, to some extent, impacted by thedisruption that arose from the integration with Sunbeam and the relatedmanagement changes, both at the acquired companies and at Sunbeam. First Alert\'ssales decline related predominately to increased inventory positions in thedomestic channel in as compared to with the remaining decreaseprimarily related to more favorable weather conditions in the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period in which affected consumer shoppingpatterns. Excluding the effects from purchase accounting and the write-off ofFirst Alert\'s goodwill, as discussed in Note of Notes to ConsolidatedFinancial Statements, operating profit for these three companies declined byapproximately million since the dates of the acquisitions in ascompared to the same period in the prior year, resulting primarily from lowernet sales. Although there can be no assurance, management anticipates thatresults from the acquired companies will significantly improve during dueto, among other things, the absence of the factors causing disruption andinsufficient focus at these three companies during . Consolidated net sales for the year ended December , were,. million, an increase of . million versus the year ended December, . After excluding: (i) ,. million of sales generated by theacquired entities, as discussed above; (ii) . million of sales in resulting from the change in fiscal year end, as described in Note of Notes toConsolidated Financial Statements; (iii) . million in and . millionin from sales of excess or discontinued inventory for which the inventorycarrying value was substantially equivalent to the sales value; (iv) .million from sales relating to divested product lines which are notclassified as discontinued operations (time and temperature products andCounselor and Borg branded scales), and (v) a . million benefit in fromthe reduction of cooperative advertising accruals no longer required(cooperative advertising costs are recorded as deductions in determining netsales), net sales on an adjusted basis (""Adjusted Sales"") of . milliondecreased approximately from Adjusted Sales of ,. million in .Product sales were adversely impacted by a number of factors, with the largestbeing changes in retail inventory levels from channel loading which took placein . The Company believes the year-to-year effect of such inventoryreductions amounted to over million. Additionally, losses in distributionof outdoor cooking products estimated at approximately million, theestimated effect of price discounting on appliance and grill products ofapproximately million, and estimated higher provisions for customer returnsand allowances of approximately million contributed to the lower sales in. The remaining sales decline was due in part to exiting certain productSKU\'s. Domestic Adjusted Sales declined approximately or million from. The Company believes more than half of the sales decline was due toincreased retail inventory levels in versus decreased inventory positionsat customers in . Excluding this effect, sales were still lower than theprior year throughout the business, with the most significant decline occurringin outdoor cooking products sales. During , the Company lost a significantportion of its outdoor cooking products distribution, including the majority ofits grill parts and accessories products distribution. The outdoor cookingproducts sales decline was attributable predominately to this lost distributionand to price discounting. The majority of the remaining sales decline was due tohigher provisions for customer returns and allowances. International sales, which represented of Adjusted Sales for ,decreased approximately compared with the Adjusted Sales for the same perioda year ago. The Company believes this sales decline was primarily attributableto decreasing customer inventory levels as compared with the prior year. Saleswere also adversely impacted by a decision to stop selling to certain exportdistributors in Latin America and by poor economic conditions in that region. Inaddition, lost distribution in Canada contributed to the sales decline from theprior year. Excluding the effect of: (i) the gross margin generated from theinclusion of the acquired entities\' operations in the period of . million,as discussed above; (ii) . million from the impact of the change in fiscalyear-end; (iii) . million in in charges recorded in the second andfourth quarters related to excess inventory and fixed assets impairments; (iv). million from the benefit in from the reversal of reserves no longerrequired, including . million of cooperative advertising accruals and (v) a. million benefit recorded in the second quarter of resulting fromcapitalizing certain manufacturing supplies inventories which were previouslyexpensed, there was a negative gross margin of . million for versus agross margin of . million for . Lower sales volume and unfavorablemanufacturing efficiencies from lower production levels associated with thelower sales volumes and high inventory levels in accounted forapproximately of the change between years. Approximately of theremaining decrease is attributable to lower price realization and higher costsof customer returns and allowances in and adverse product sales mix in. The adverse product sales mix was due <PAGE>in part to the loss of a majority of the grill accessory products distributionas accessories generate significantly better margins than the average margins onsales of most of the Company\'s other products. Costs associated with a blanketrecall, higher warranty reserves and inventory adjustments due in part tophysical inventories drove the remaining decrease in gross margin. Excluding the effect of: (i) . million of SG&A charges in theacquired entities, including the . million goodwill write-off related toFirst Alert; (ii) . million recorded in the third quarter of related tothe issuance of warrants; (iii) . million of SG&A expense in from thechange in the fiscal period; (iv) a . million benefit in and a .million benefit in from the reversal of reserves no longer required; (v)approximately million of compensation expense recorded in connectionwith new employment agreements with the Company\'s former Chairman and ChiefExecutive Officer and two other former senior officers and approximately million of severance in for certain former employees; (vi) . million,. million, and . million of costs recorded in related to costsassociated with the restatement efforts, Year compliance efforts and acorporate office relocation, respectively, and (vii) . million ofrestructuring related charges recorded in , SG&A expenses were approximately million in , higher than the same period in . This increase ofapproximately million is due to several factors. Corporate administrativecosts increased by approximately million, reflecting additional personneland related relocation, travel and other costs, as well as increased outsideprovider fees, telecommunications expense and insurance. Higher allowances foraccounts receivable in , accounting for approximately million of theincrease, related primarily to collection issues with certain customers in theU.S. and in Latin America, including several major customers who have filedandor threatened bankruptcy. Advertising, marketing and selling expensesincreased by approximately million, reflecting a national televisioncampaign for grills and increased activity in market research, package designand sales efforts. Higher inventory levels in and costs associated withoutsourcing small parts fulfillment led to higher distribution and warehousingcosts of approximately million. Increased environmental reserves fordivested and closed facilities added approximately million while settlementof a patent infringement action resulted in additional expense of approximately million. During , the Company determined that the amounts accrued atDecember , for Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges recorded infiscal exceeded amounts ultimately required. Accordingly, the Consolidated Statement of Operations reflects the reversal of accruals no longerrequired, resulting in a Restructuring and Asset Impairment Benefit of .million. This reversal was reflected in the third (. million) and fourth(. million) quarters of when it became evident that such accruals wereno longer required. Operating results for and , on an adjusted basis as describedabove, were a loss of approximately million in and a profit ofapproximately million in . This change resulted from the factorsdiscussed above. Interest expense increased from . million for the twelve months of to . million for the same period in . Approximately of thechange related to higher borrowing levels in for the acquisitions, with theremainder due to increased borrowings to fund working capital, capitalexpenditures and the operating losses. Other income, net increased in by . million due toapproximately million from the settlement of a lawsuit, and approximately million of increased net gains from foreign exchange in the period. The foreignexchange net gains were primarily from Mexico. Increased losses on sales offixed assets of approximately million and increased expenses related to theNew Credit Facility partially offset the above mentioned income. The increasedcredit facility expenses largely related to unused facility fees. The minority interest reported in relates to the minority interestheld in Coleman by public shareholders. During , the current tax provision arose largely from taxes on theearnings of foreign subsidiaries as well as franchise taxes. Deferred taxbenefits were recognized in principally due to net operating lossesincurred subsequent to the acquisitions. These benefits were realized throughthe use of deferred tax credits that were established in connection with theacquisitions to the extent that such credits are expected to be realized in theloss carryforward period. During , the Company increased the income taxvaluation allowance on deferred tax assets to . million. This increasereflects management\'s assessment that it is more likely than not that thesedeferred tax assets will not be realized through future taxable income. The effective tax rate was higher than the federal statutory income tax rateprimarily due to state taxes, the effects of foreign earnings and dividendstaxed at other rates and the impact of providing a valuation allowance ondeferred tax assets. In , the Company prepaid certain debt assumed in the acquisitionsand prepaid an industrial revenue bond related to its Hattiesburg facility. Inconnection with these early extinguishments of debt, the Company recognized anextraordinary charge of . million, consisting primarily of redemptionpremiums. <PAGE> The Company\'s discontinued furniture business, which was sold in March, had revenues of . million in the first quarter of prior to thesale and nominal earnings for that period. As a result of the sale of theCompany\'s furniture business assets (primarily inventory, property, plant andequipment), the Company received . million in cash, retained approximately million in accounts receivable and retained certain liabilities. The finalpurchase price for the furniture business was subject to a post-closingadjustment based on the terms of the sale agreement and in the first quarter of, after completion of the sale, the Company recorded an additional loss ondisposal of . million, net of applicable income tax benefits of .million.YEAR ENDED DECEMBER , COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER , RESTRUCTURING PLAN AND OTHER CHARGES AND BENEFITS In November , the Company announced the details of a restructuringplan. The plan included the consolidation of administrative functions, thereduction of manufacturing and warehouse facilities, the centralization of theCompany\'s procurement function and the reduction of the Company\'s productofferings and SKU\'s. The restructuring plan also included the elimination ofcertain businesses and product lines. As part of the restructuring plan, the Company consolidated sixdivisional and regional headquarters functions into a single worldwide corporateheadquarters and outsourced certain back office activities resulting in areduction in total back-officeadministrative headcount. Overall, therestructuring plan called for a reduction in the number of production facilitiesfrom to and the elimination of over , positions from the Company\'sworkforce, including , from the disposition of certain business operationsand the elimination of approximately , other positions, some of which wereoutsourced. The Company completed the major phases of the restructuring plan byJuly . In conjunction with the implementation of the restructuring plan, theCompany recorded a pre-tax charge of . million in the fourth quarter of. This amount is recorded as follows in the Consolidated Statements ofOperations: . million recorded in Restructuring and Asset ImpairmentCharges, as further described below; . million in Cost of Goods Sold relatedprincipally to inventory write-downs as a result of a reduction in SKU\'s andcosts of inventory liquidation programs; . million in SG&A expense, forperiod costs principally relating to outsourcing and package redesign, and .million (. million net of taxes) in Loss on Sale of Discontinued Operationsrelated to the divestiture of its furniture business. In , upon completionof the sale of the furniture business, the Company recorded an additionalpre-tax loss of . million from discontinued operations (. million net oftaxes) due primarily to lower than anticipated sales proceeds relating to thepost closing adjustment process that was part of the sale agreement. Amounts included in Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges in in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations included anticipatedcash charges such as severance and other employee costs of . million, leaseobligations of . million and other exit costs associated with facilityclosures and related to the implementation of the restructuring plan of .million, principally representing costs related to clean-up and restoration offacilities for either sale or return to the landlord. Included in Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges in was. million of non-cash charges principally consisting of: (a) assetwrite-downs to net realizable value for disposals of excess facilities andequipment and certain product lines (. million); (b) write-offs of redundantcomputer systems from the administrative back-office consolidations andoutsourcing initiatives (. million); (c) write-off of intangibles relatingto discontinued product lines (. million); (d) write-off of capitalizedproduct and package design costs and other expenses related to exited productlines and SKU reductions (. million), and (e) losses related to thedivestiture of certain non-core products and businesses (. million). Theasset write-downs of . million included equipment taken out of service in (either abandoned in or sold in ) and accordingly, depreciationwas not recorded subsequent to the date of the impairment charge. The losses of. million related to the divestiture of non-core products and businessesresulted from divesting of the time and temperature business (sold in March) and Counselor and Borg scale product lines (sold in May ) and the saleof the textile mill in Biddeford, Maine in May . These charges primarilyrepresented the estimated non-cash loss to exit these products, including fixedassets and inventory write-downs and other costs related to exiting theseproduct lines. The . million for severance and other employee costs, includingCOBRA and other fringe benefits, related to approximately , positions thatwere planned to be eliminated as a result of the restructuring plan, excludingapproximately , employees terminated from the furniture business for whichseverance was included in Loss on Sale of Discontinued Operations (see Note of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The furniture business was soldin . In and , approximately , employees and , employees,respectively, were terminated from continuing operations. <PAGE>Due largely to attrition, the remaining planned terminations were not required.In , the Company determined that its severance and related employee costswere less than originally accrued principally due to lower than expectedseverance and COBRA costs and, accordingly, reversed accruals of . million inthe third and fourth quarters. At December , , the balance accrued of .million represented the remaining severance and related employee costs forcertain employees terminated during . During , all amounts wereexpended. The amounts accrued at December , for Restructuring and AssetImpairment Charges recorded in fiscal , exceeded amounts ultimately requiredprincipally due to reductions in anticipated severance costs of . million, asdiscussed above, and reductions in estimated lease payments of . millionresulting from better than anticipated rentals received under sub-leases andfavorable negotiation of lease terminations. Accordingly, the fiscal Consolidated Statement of Operations included . million of benefit (.million in the third quarter and . million in the fourth quarter of )related to the reversal of accruals no longer required, which were recorded asthese reduced obligations became known. In , in conjunction with the initiation of the restructuring plan,the Company recorded additional charges totaling . million, reflected inCost of Goods Sold, SG&A expense, and Loss on Sale of Discontinued Operations.The charge included in Cost of Goods Sold (. million) principallyrepresented inventory write-downs and anticipated losses on the disposition ofthe inventory as a result of the significant reduction in SKU\'s provided for inthe restructuring plan.

As further discussed in Note of Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements, during the fourth quarter of , the Company charged SG&A expensefor increases of . million in environmental reserves and . million inlitigation reserves. In the fourth quarter of , the Company performed acomprehensive review of all environmental exposures in an attempt by the thennew senior management team to accelerate the resolution and settlement ofenvironmental claims.

After excluding: (i) . million and . million in and, respectively, related to divested product lines which are not classifiedas discontinued operations (time and temperature products, decorative beddingand Counselor and Borg branded scales), (ii) . million of sales in ofdiscontinued inventory which resulted primarily from the reduction of SKU\'s aspart of the restructuring plan and for which the inventory carrying valuewas substantially equivalent to the sales value, and (iii) a . millionbenefit from the reduction of cooperative advertising accruals no longerrequired in , Adjusted Sales increased over the prior year to ,.million from . million in . Adjusted Sales, on a worldwide basis, increased during primarilyfrom new product introductions, expanded distribution (particularly with theCompany\'s top ten customers), international geographic expansion and increasedinventory positions at certain customers. Adjusted Sales growth wasapproximately for appliances and approximately in outdoor cooking.Adjusted Sales for health products increased approximately while AdjustedSales of personal care products and blankets decreased approximately during. Sales increases in appliances of approximately million, were drivenby new products, such as re-designed blenders and mixers, coffeemakers, irons,deep fryers and toasters, coupled with increased distribution with largenational mass retailers, combined with higher inventory levels at certaincustomers. Sales of outdoor cooking products increased approximately millionin attributed to increased merchandising and advertising programs, newdistribution and higher inventory levels at certain customers. During , theCompany lost a significant portion of its outdoor cooking products distribution,including the majority of its grill accessory products distribution.Accessories, which accounted for just over of the outdoor cooking salesvolume in , generate significantly better margins than the average marginson sales of grills. These distribution changes are expected to adversely impactoutdoor cooking sales and margins in the future, until such time as thedistribution is regained. Sales of personal care products and blankets suffered during the fourthquarter of as a result of lower than expected retail sell through ofelectric blankets in key northern markets in late coupled with theinability to service demand for king and queen sized blankets due to shortagesof blanket shells. This resulted in a sales decline of approximately millionas compared with the prior year. The Company shifted to a more level productionfor blankets in in order to more adequately service the seasonal demand forbedding products. Sales of health products as well as personal care and beddingproducts were impacted by increased inventory positions at customers in . International sales, which represented of total revenues in ,grew during the year. This sales growth was driven primarily by new volt product introductions and a general improvement in demand in exportoperations and in Mexico. Net sales growth of approximately was achieved inthe Latin American export sales organization. Most of this growth came fromincreased business with three exporters. In Mexico and Venezuela, sales grew and , respectively. Canada accounted for the majority of the remaininginternational sales growth. Excluding the effect of: (i) charges to Cost of Goods Sold related tothe restructuring plan in (. million), (ii) the benefit of reducingreserves no longer required in (. million), and (iii) the benefit in of capitalizing manufacturing supplies inventories (. million), grossmargin as a percent of Adjusted Sales would have been approximately in ,an improvement of approximately percentage points from in . Thisincrease reflects the results of lower overhead spending, improved factoryutilization and labor cost benefits resulting from the Company\'s restructuringplan, coupled with reductions in certain materials costs. The lower overheadspending resulted from a reduction in the number of facilities operated by theCompany. With fewer facilities used for production purposes, the capacity of theremaining plants was more fully utilized. The labor cost benefits were realizedprincipally from shifting production to Mexico. In addition, a broad basedprogram to obtain lower costs for materials contributed to the marginimprovement. Excluding the impact of: (i) the restructuring and asset impairmentperiod costs to SG&A expense in (. million) and (. million),(ii) the charges for the environmental accrual (. million), litigationaccrual (. million), and <PAGE>restricted stock grant compensation (. million), and (iii) the benefitfrom the reversal of reserves no longer required (. million), SG&A expenseimproved to of Adjusted Sales in , down percentage points from in. This improvement was partially the result of benefits from theconsolidation of six divisional and regional headquarters into one corporateheadquarters and one administrative operations center, reduced staffing levels,a reduction in the number of warehouses, and Company-wide cost controlinitiatives. Higher expenditures in for market research, new packaging andother discretionary charges and higher bad debt expenses associated with certainof the Company\'s customers also contributed to the decrease in SG&A expensesfrom to . The expense for doubtful accounts and cash discounts was. million in as compared to . million in . The principal factorin the decrease in bad debt expenses during this period was the acceleration ofthe consolidation of the U.S. retail industry and the related competitiveenvironment, which resulted in a number of troubled retailers and relatedbankruptcies during . This resulted in the significant amount of bad debtwrite-offs (. million) in . Operating results for and , on a comparable basis as describedabove, were earnings of . million in and a loss of . million in. On the same basis, operating margin increased percentage points to of Adjusted Sales in versus a loss of in . This improvement resultedfrom the factors discussed above. Interest expense decreased from . million in to . millionin primarily as a result of lower average borrowing levels in . The effective income tax rate for continuing operations was higherthan the federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to state taxes plus theeffect of foreign earnings and dividends taxed at other rates and the increaseto the valuation reserve for deferred tax assets, offset in part by the reversalof tax liabilities no longer required. In the fourth quarter of , theCompany increased the valuation allowance by . million reflectingmanagement\'s assessment that it was more likely than not that the deferred taxasset will not be realized through future taxable income. Of this amount, .million related to deferred tax assets, the majority of which was recognized asa benefit in the first three quarters of . The remainder related to minimumpension liabilities and was therefore recorded as an adjustment to shareholders\'equity. This assessment was made as a result of the significant leverageundertaken by the Company as part of the acquisitions and the significantdecline in net sales and earnings from anticipated levels during the fourthquarter of and the first quarter of . For , the effective incometax rate for continuing operations equaled the federal statutory income taxrate. The Company\'s diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was. per share in versus a loss per share from continuing operations in of .. The Company\'s share base utilized in the diluted earnings pershare calculation increased approximately during as a result of anincrease in the number of shares of common stock outstanding due to the exerciseof stock options in and the inclusion of common stock equivalents in the calculation. The Company\'s discontinued furniture business, which was sold in March, had revenues of . million in the first quarter of prior to thesale and nominal earnings. In , the discontinued furniture business had netincome of . million on revenues of . million and an estimated loss ondisposal of the business of . million, net of applicable income taxbenefits. The sale of the Company\'s furniture business assets (primarilyinventory, property, plant and equipment) was completed in March . TheCompany received . million in cash, retained approximately . million inaccounts receivable and retained certain liabilities related to the furniturebusiness. The final purchase price for the furniture business was subject to apost-closing adjustment based on the terms of the asset purchase agreement andin the first quarter of , after completion of the sale, the Company recordedan additional loss on disposal of . million pre-tax. Although thediscontinued furniture business was profitable, net income had declined from. million in to . million in . This decline, along with theCompany\'s announcement that it intended to divest this line of businesscontributed to the loss on the sale. See discussion of restructuring and assetimpairment (benefit) charges in Note and discontinued operations in Note of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regardingsale of the furniture business. <PAGE>SUMMARY OF (LOSS) EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS A reconciliation of operating (loss) earnings to adjusted (loss)earnings from continuing operations for , and , on a comparablebasis follows (in millions):<TABLE><CAPTION> --------- --------- ---------<S> <C> <C> <C>Operating (loss) earnings, as reported..........................................

Results for are expected to be impacted by the continuingeffects of the Company\'s excess inventory position, as well as costs related toYear compliance efforts.FOREIGN OPERATIONS Approximately of the Company\'s business is conducted in U.S.dollars (including both domestic sales, U.S. dollar denominated export sales,primarily to certain Latin American markets, Asian sales and the majority ofEuropean sales). The Company\'s non-U.S. dollar denominated sales are madeprincipally by subsidiaries in Europe, Canada, Japan, Latin America and Mexico.Mexico reverted to a hyperinflationary status for accounting purposes in ;therefore, translation adjustments related to Mexican net monetary assets areincluded as a component of net (loss) earnings. Mexico is not consideredhyperinflationary as of January , . This change in Mexico\'shyperinflationary status is not expected to have a material effect on theCompany\'s financial results. Translation adjustments resulting from theCompany\'s non-U.S. denominated subsidiaries have not had a material impact onthe Company\'s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. While revenues generated in Asia have traditionally not beensignificant, economic instability in this region is expected to have a negativeeffect on earnings. Economic instability and the political environment in LatinAmerica have also affected sales in that region. It is anticipated that sales inand exports to these regions will continue to decline so long as the economicenvironments in those regions remain unsettled. <PAGE> On a limited basis, the Company selectively uses derivatives (foreignexchange option and forward contracts) to manage foreign exchange exposures thatarise in the normal course of business. No derivative contracts are entered intofor trading or speculative purposes. The use of derivatives has not had amaterial impact on the Company\'s financial results. (See Note of Notes toConsolidated Financial Statements).EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISKQUALITATIVE INFORMATION The Company uses a variety of derivative financial instruments tomanage its foreign currency and interest rate exposures. The Company does notspeculate on interest rates or foreign currency rates. Instead, it usesderivatives when implementing its risk management strategies to reduce thepossible effects of these exposures. With respect to foreign currency exposures, the Company is mostvulnerable to changes in rates between the United States dollarJapanese yen,Canadian dollar, German deutschmark, Mexican peso and Venezuelan bolivarexchange rates. The Company principally uses forward and option contracts toreduce risks arising from firm commitments, intercompany sales transactions andintercompany receivable and payable balances. The Company generally usesinterest rate swaps to fix certain of its variable rate debt. The Companymanages credit risk related to these derivative contracts through creditapprovals, exposure limits and threshold amounts and other monitoringprocedures.QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION Set forth below are tabular presentations of certain informationrelated to Sunbeam\'s investments in market risk sensitive instruments. All ofthe instruments set forth in the following tables have been entered into by theCompany for purposes other than trading purposes.INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY The table below provides information about the Company\'s derivativefinancial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive tochanges in interest rates, including interest rate swaps and debt obligations.

The transition period for theintroduction of the Euro is between January , and January , . TheCompany has been preparing for the introduction of the Euro and continues toevaluate and address the many issues involved, including the conversion ofinformation technology systems, recalculating currency risk, strategiesconcerning continuity of contracts, and impacts on the processes for preparingtaxation and accounting records. Based on the work to date, the Company believesthe Euro conversion will not have a material impact on its results ofoperations.SEASONALITY Sunbeam\'s sales, prior to the acquisitions, have not traditionallyexhibited substantial seasonality; however, sales have been strongest during thefourth quarter of the calendar year. Additionally, sales of outdoor cookingproducts are strongest in the first half of the year, while sales of appliances,personal care and blanket products are strongest in the second half of the year.After considering the seasonality of the acquired entities, Sunbeam\'sconsolidated sales are not expected to exhibit substantial seasonality; however,sales are expected to be strongest during the second quarter of the calendaryear. Furthermore, sales of a number of products, including warming blankets,vaporizers, humidifiers, grills, First Alert products, camping and generatorproducts may be impacted by unseasonable weather conditions. <PAGE>LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES In order to finance the acquisition of Coleman, First Alert andSignature Brands and to refinance substantially all of the indebtedness of theCompany and the three acquired entities, the Company consummated an offering ofDebentures at a yield to maturity of (approximately , million principalamount at maturity) in March , which resulted in approximately millionof net proceeds and entered into the New Credit Facility. The Debentures are exchangeable for shares of the Company\'s commonstock at an initial conversion rate of . shares for each , principalamount at maturity of the Debentures, subject to adjustment upon occurrence ofcertain events. The Debentures are subordinated in right of payment to allexisting and future senior indebtedness of the Company. The Debentures are notredeemable by the Company prior to March , . On or after such date, theDebentures are redeemable for cash with at least days notice, at the optionof the Company. The Company is required to purchase Debentures at the option ofthe holder as of March , , March , and March , , at purchaseprices equal to the issue price plus accrued original discount to such dates.The Company may, at its option, elect to pay any such purchase price in cash orcommon stock or any combination thereof. The Company was required to file aregistration statement with the SEC to register the Debentures by June , .This registration statement was filed on February , and the SEC has notdeclared the registration statement effective. Sunbeam\'s failure to file theregistration statement by June , did not constitute default under theterms of the Debentures. As part of the normal review process by the SEC, anumber of comments have been made by the staff of the division of CorporationFinance relating to the registration statement and the restated and financial statements included therein. The Company expects to resolve thesecomments when it files an amendment to the registration statement. From June , until the registration statement is declared effective, the Company isrequired to pay to the Debenture holders cash liquidated damages accruing, foreach day during such period, at a rate per annum equal to . during the first days and . thereafter multiplied by the total of the issue price of theDebentures plus the original issue discount thereon on such day. The Companymade its first payment of approximately . million to the Debenture holders onSeptember , and an additional . million was paid on March , . Concurrent with the acquisitions, the Company replaced its millionsyndicated unsecured five-year revolving credit facility with the New CreditFacility. The New Credit Facility provided for aggregate borrowings of up to. billion. As a result of operating losses incurred in fiscal , amongother things, the Company was not in compliance with certain covenants set forthin the New Credit Facility. The Company and its lenders entered into agreementsas of June , , October , and April , , in each case providingfor waivers of compliance with such covenants under the New Credit Facility.Effective April , , Sunbeam and its lenders entered into an agreementwhich waived compliance with such covenants through April , and providedfor new financial covenants. The following description of the New CreditFacility reflects the terms of the New Credit Facility as amended through April, . The New Credit Facility provided for aggregate borrowings of up to .billion pursuant to: (i) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principalamount of up to . million maturing March , (. million of whichmay only be used to complete the Coleman merger if the Coleman merger is notcompleted prior to August , ); (ii) . million in term loans maturingon March , (of which . million may only be used to complete theColeman merger) and (iii) a . million term loan maturing September ,. As of December , , approximately . billion was outstanding andapproximately . billion was available for borrowing under the New CreditFacility. Pursuant to the New Credit Facility, interest accrues, at the Company\'soption: (i) at the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") or (ii) at the baserate of the administrative agent which is generally the higher of the primecommercial lending rate of the administrative agent or the Federal Funds Rateplus ., in each case plus an agreed upon interest margin which is currently. for LIBOR borrowings and . for base rate borrowings. The applicableinterest margin is subject to downward adjustment upon the occurrence of certainevents. Borrowings under the New Credit Facility are secured by a pledge of thestock of the Company\'s material subsidiaries, including Coleman, and by asecurity interest in substantially all of the assets of Sunbeam and its materialdomestic subsidiaries, other than Coleman and its material subsidiaries exceptas described below. Currently, Coleman\'s inventory and related assets arepledged to secure its obligations for letters of credit issued for its accountunder the New Credit Facility. Additionally, as security for Coleman\'s notepayable to the Company, Coleman pledged substantially all of its domesticassets, other than real property, including of the stock of its directforeign subsidiaries and domestic holding companies for its foreignsubsidiaries, and all of the stock of its other direct domestic subsidiaries(but not the assets of Coleman\'s subsidiaries). The pledge runs in favor ofSunbeam\'s lending banks, to which the Coleman note has been pledged as securityfor Sunbeam\'s obligations to them. Upon completion of the Coleman merger,substantially all of Coleman\'s assets and the assets of Coleman\'s domesticsubsidiaries will be pledged to secure the obligations under the New CreditFacility. In addition, borrowings under the New Credit Facility are guaranteedby a number of the Company\'s wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries andthese subsidiary <PAGE>guarantees are secured as described above. Upon completion of the Colemanmerger, Coleman and each of its United States subsidiaries will becomeguarantors of the obligations under the New Credit Facility. To the extentborrowings are made by any subsidiaries of the Company, the obligations of suchsubsidiaries are guaranteed by the Company. The New Credit Facility contains covenants customary for creditfacilities of a similar nature, including limitations on the ability of Sunbeamand its subsidiaries, including Coleman, to, among other things, (i) declaredividends or repurchase stock, (ii) prepay, redeem or repurchase debt, incurliens and engage in sale-leaseback transactions, (iii) make loans andinvestments, (iv) incur additional debt, (v) amend or otherwise alter materialagreements or enter into restrictive agreements, (vi) make capital and year compliance expenditures, (vii) engage in mergers, acquisitions and asset sales,(viii) engage in certain transactions with affiliates, (ix) settle certainlitigation, (x) alter its cash management system and (xi) alter the businessesthey conduct. Sunbeam is also required to comply with specified financialcovenants and ratios. The New Credit Facility provides for events of defaultcustomary for transactions of this type, including nonpayment,misrepresentation, breach of covenant, cross-defaults, bankruptcy, materialadverse change arising from compliance with ERISA, material adverse judgments,entering into guarantees and change of ownership and control. It is also anevent of default under the New Credit Facility if Sunbeam\'s registrationstatement in connection with the Coleman merger is not declared effective by theSEC on or before October , or if the merger does not occur within business days of the effectiveness of the registration statement or if the cashconsideration (including any payments on account of the exercise of anyappraisal rights, but excluding related legal, accounting and other customaryfees and expenses) to consummate the Coleman merger exceeds . million.Although there can be no assurance, the Company anticipates that it will satisfythese conditions. Unless waived by the bank lenders, the failure to satisfythese requirements (as with the occurrence of any other event of default) wouldpermit the bank lenders to accelerate the maturity of all outstanding borrowingsunder the New Credit Facility. The New Credit Facility also includes provisionsfor the deferral of the scheduled term loan payments of . million,subject to delivery of certain collateral documents and the filing of anamendment to the Company\'s registration statement on Form S- relating to theColeman merger. If these conditions are met, and there are no events of default,the scheduled loan payments will be extended until April , . The Companyanticipates that it will satisfy these conditions and, accordingly, hasclassified these amounts as long-term in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December , , the Company had cash and cash equivalents of. million, working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents of .million and total debt of . billion. Cash used in operating activities during was . million compared to . million used in operating activities in. This change is primarily attributable to lower earnings after givingeffect to non-cash charges partially offset by improvements in working capital.During , . million in cash was generated by reducing receivables,including the effects of the securitization program described below, andreducing inventories, which was partially offset by a . million reduction inaccounts payable levels. In the fourth quarter of , cash provided byoperating activities totaled . million, principally due to cash generated byreducing receivables and inventories of . million, partially offset by thepreviously discussed reduction in earnings. The decrease in cash provided byoperations from to is primarily attributable to increased inventorylevels in and spending in related to the restructuring initiativesaccrued for in , largely offset by an increase in cash generated by earningsin and an income tax refund (net of payments) in . Cash used inoperating activities reflects proceeds of . million in and .million in from the Company\'s revolving trade accounts receivablesecuritization program, as more fully described below. Cash used in investing activities in reflects . million forthe acquisitions. In , cash provided by investing activities reflected .million in proceeds from the sales of divested operations and other assets.Capital spending totaled . million in and was primarily formanufacturing efficiency initiatives, equipment and tooling for new products,and management information systems hardware and software licenses. The newproduct capital spending principally related to the air and water filtrationproducts which were discontinued in the second quarter of , electricblankets, grills, clippers and appliances. Capital spending in was .million and was primarily attributable to manufacturing capacity expansion, costreduction initiatives and equipment to manufacture new products. The new productcapital spending in principally related to appliances and included costsrelated to blenders, toasters, stand mixers, slow cookers and a soft serve icecream product. Capital spending in was . million (including .million related to the discontinued furniture business) and was primarilyattributable to equipment for new product development and cost reductioninitiatives. The Company anticipates capital spending to be approximately of net sales, primarily related to new product introductions, capacityadditions, certain facility rationalization initiatives and systems hardware andsoftware. As discussed above, the Company\'s capital and Year complianceexpenditures are limited under the terms of the New Credit Facility. Cash provided by financing activities totaled . million in and reflects the net proceeds from the sale of Debentures of . million, thecancellation and repayment of all outstanding balances under the Company\'s million September revolving credit facility, the repayment of certain debtacquired with the acquisitions, the early extinguishment of the . millionHattiesburg industrial revenue bond and net borrowings under the New CreditFacility. In addition, cash provided by financing activities during includes . million of proceeds from the exercise of stock <PAGE>options. During , cash provided by financing activities of . millionreflects net borrowings of . million under the Company\'s September revolving credit facility, . million of debt repayments related to thedivested furniture business and other assets sold and . million in cashproceeds from the exercise of stock options. In , cash provided by financingactivities of . million was primarily from increased revolving creditfacility borrowings of . million to support working capital and capitalspending requirements, . million in new issuances of long-term debt and .million in proceeds from the sale of treasury shares to certain executives ofthe Company. In December , the Company entered into a revolving trade accountsreceivable securitization program, which as amended expires in March , tosell without recourse, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, certain trade accountsreceivable, up to a maximum of million. The Company, as agent for thepurchaser of the receivables, retains collection and administrativeresponsibilities for the purchased receivables. For the year ended December ,, the Company had sold approximately million of accounts receivableunder this program. At December , , the Company had reduced accountsreceivable by . million for receivables sold under this program. The Companyexpects to continue the securitization program to finance a portion of itsaccounts receivable. See Note of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. At December , , standby and commercial letters of creditaggregated . million and were predominately for insurance, pension,environmental, workers\' compensation, and international trade activities. Inaddition, as of December , , surety bonds with a contract value of .million were outstanding largely as a result of litigation judgements that arecurrently under appeal. For additional information relating to the Debentures, the New CreditFacility and the repayment of certain debt, see Note of Notes to ConsolidatedFinancial Statements. The Company expects to acquire the remaining equity interest in Colemanpursuant to a merger transaction in which the existing Coleman minorityshareholders will receive . share of the Company\'s common stock and .in cash for each share of Coleman common stock outstanding. In addition,unexercised options under Coleman\'s stock option plans will be cashed out at aprice per share equal to the difference between . and the exercise price ofsuch options. The Company expects to issue approximately . million shares ofcommon stock and expend approximately million in cash, including cash paidto option holders, to complete the Coleman transaction. (See Notes and ofNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) Although there can be no assurance,it is anticipated that the Coleman merger will occur in the second half offiscal . The Company is a party to various environmental proceedings,substantially all related to previously divested operations and to Colemansites. In management\'s opinion, the ultimate resolution of these environmentalmatters will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company\'s financialcondition, results of operations or cash flows. See Note of Notes toConsolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes its borrowing capacity under the New CreditFacility, cash flow from the combined operations of the Company and its acquiredcompanies, existing cash and cash equivalent balances, and its receivablesecuritization program will be sufficient to support working capital needs,capital and Year compliance spending, and debt service through April ,. However, if the Company is unable to obtain a further waiver of thecovenant and ratio requirements prior to April , , the Company expects itwould, at that time, be in default of the requirements under the New CreditFacility and, as noted above, the lenders could then require the repayment ofall amounts then outstanding under the New Credit Facility. By letter dated June , , the staff of the Division of Enforcementof the SEC advised the Company that it was conducting an informal inquiry intothe Company\'s accounting policies and procedures and requested that the Companyproduce certain documents. On July , , the SEC issued a Formal Order ofPrivate Investigation, designating officers to take testimony and pursuant towhich a subpoena duces tecum was served on the Company requiring the productionof certain documents. On November , , the Company received another SECsubpoena duces tecum requiring the production of further documents. The Companyhas provided numerous documents to the SEC staff and continues to cooperatefully with the SEC staff. The Company cannot predict the term of suchinvestigation or its potential outcome. <PAGE> The Company is involved in significant litigation, including class andderivative actions, relating to events which led to the restatement of itsconsolidated financial statements, the issuance of the M&F warrants, the sale ofthe Debentures and the employment agreements, attorney fees and expenses ofMessrs. Dunlap and Kersh. The Company intends to vigorously defend each of theactions, but cannot predict the outcome and is not currently able to evaluatethe likelihood of the Company\'s success in each case or the range of potentialloss. However, if these actions were determined adversely to the Company, suchjudgements would have a material adverse effect on the Company\'s financialposition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, the Company\'sinsurance carriers have filed various suits requesting a declaratory judgementthat the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policies for excesscoverage was invalid andor had been properly cancelled by the carriers or haveadvised the Company of their intent to deny coverage under such policies. TheCompany intends to pursue recovery from all of its insurers if damages arerewarded against the Company or its indemnified officers andor directors underany of the foregoing actions. The Company\'s failure to obtain such insurancerecoveries following an adverse judgement against the Company on any of theforegoing actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company\'sfinancial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company and its subsidiaries are also involved in various lawsuitsfrom time to time that the Company considers to be ordinary routine litigationincidental to its business. In the opinion of the Company, the resolution ofthese routine matters, and of certain matters relating to prior operations,individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on thefinancial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. For additional information relating to litigation, see also Item -""Legal Proceedings.""NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In March , the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants(""AICPA"") issued Statement of Position -, ACCOUNTING FOR THE COSTS OFCOMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPED OR OBTAINED FOR INTERNAL USE (""SOP -"").

Year issues could include potential problems in the informationtechnology (""IT"") and non-IT systems that the Company uses in its operations andproblems in the Company\'s products. Year system failures could affectroutine but critical operations such as forecasting, purchasing, production,order processing, inventory control, shipping, billing and collection. Inaddition, system failures could affect the Company\'s security, payrolloperations, or employee safety. The Company may also be exposed to potentialrisks from third parties with whom the Company interacts who fail to adequatelyaddress their own Year issues.SUNBEAM\'S APPROACH TO YEAR ISSUES While the Company\'s Year readiness planning has been underway forover one year, during the third quarter of the Company established across-functional project team consisting of senior managers, assisted by threeexternal consulting firms which were retained to provide consulting services andto assist the Company in implementing its Year strategy. This team issponsored by the Company\'s Chief Financial Officer who reports directly to theCompany\'s Chief Executive Officer on this issue. The Audit Committee of theBoard of Directors is advised periodically on the status of the Company\'s Year readiness program. <PAGE> The Year project team has developed a phased approach to identifyand resolve Year issues with many of these activities conducted inparallel. The Company\'s approach and the anticipated timing of each phase aredescribed below. PHASE - INVENTORY AND ASSESSMENT: During the first phase of Sunbeam\'sYear readiness program, the Company established a Year ProgramManagement Office (""PMO"") to centralize the management of all of the Company\'sYear projects. Through this office, the Company developed a corporate-wide,uniform strategy for assessing and addressing the Year issues. The Company has completed an inventory of its hardware and softwaresystems, manufacturing equipment, electronic data interchange,telecommunications and other technical assets potentially subject to Year problems, such as security systems and controls for lighting, air conditioning,ventilation and facility access. This inventory was then entered into theCompany\'s Year database along with a determination of the item\'s level ofcriticality to operations. For those inventory items anticipated to have asignificant effect on the business if not corrected, the Company\'s Year program envisions repair or replacement and testing of such items. Allinformation relative to each item is being tracked in the Company\'s Year database. The Company completed most of this phase during the third and fourthquarters of . The Company has completed a review of the readiness ofembedded microprocessors in its products and determined that none of theCompany\'s products have Year date sensitive systems. PHASE - CORRECTION AND TESTING: The second phase of Sunbeam\'s Year readiness program is structured to replace, upgrade or remediate (asnecessary) those items identified during Phase as requiring corrective action. Sunbeam relies on its IT functions to perform many tasks that arecritical to its operations. Significant transactions that could be impacted bynot being ready for any Year issues include, among others, purchases ofmaterials, production management, order entry and fulfillment, and payrollprocessing. Systems and applications that have been identified by Sunbeam todate as not currently Year ready and which are critical to Sunbeam\'soperations include its financial software systems, which process the orderentry, purchasing, production management, general ledger, accounts receivable,and accounts payable functions, payroll applications, and critical applicationsin the Company\'s manufacturing and distribution facilities, such as warehousemanagement applications. In , the Company began implementing a uniforminternational business and accounting information system to improve internalreporting processes. Based upon representations from the manufacturer that thecurrent version of this uniform information system is Year ready, theCompany has been actively upgrading its business sites that currently utilizethis uniform system to the Year ready version. A small number of otherCompany business locations are replacing their current non-Year readysystems with this new uniform system. The Company is also actively replacing andor upgrading legacy businesssystems that are not Year ready, including those that use localizedbusiness system packages which were not candidates to be replaced by the uniformbusiness and accounting information system. With respect to the Company\'s non-ITsystems (for example, time and attendance, security, and in-line manufacturinghardware) the Company is actively analyzing these items to assess any Year issues. To date, no material issues have been discovered, and the Company willcontinue to review, test and correct, if necessary, such items. Sunbeam plans to complete the corrective work described above withrespect to its systems by the second quarter of with final testing andimplementation of such systems occurring in the second and third quarters of. PHASE - CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS: The third phaseof Sunbeam\'s Year readiness program which was initiated during the thirdand fourth quarters of is designed to assess and interact with theCompany\'s customers, suppliers, and business partners. As part of this effort,the Company surveyed , vendors and suppliers determined to be critical tothe Company. Based on the survey, the Company believes that there is only a lowto medium risk of Year issues for approximately one-third of its vendors;however, a small number of vendors have been identified as high risk (less than) and almost two-thirds of the vendors did not respond fully to the survey.The Company will continue its vendor evaluation and assessment process through, including direct contact with high and medium risk vendors and vendors whohave not responded fully to the Company\'s survey. The Company has notindependently verified the responses of vendors and does not anticipateundertaking such independent verification process. Beginning in the second quarter of , Sunbeam will also contact itsmajor customers to confirm their preparations for Year issues. The Companyhas already responded to numerous customer inquiries and believes that all ofthe Company\'s major customers have established programs to deal with Year issues. In order to improve the Company\'s <PAGE>communication with its customers, suppliers and business partners, the Companyhas set up a Sunbeam Year telephone number and is in the process ofproviding Year information on a Company web site. PHASE - CONTINGENCY PLANNING: This phase will involve contingencyplanning for unresolved Year issues, particularly any issues arising withthird party suppliers. The Company\'s Year readiness program is ongoing andits ultimate scope, as well as the consideration of contingency plans, willcontinue to be evaluated as new information becomes available. As aprecautionary measure, Sunbeam plans to establish a contingency plan foraddressing any effects of the Year on its operations, whether due toSunbeam\'s systems or those of third parties not being ready for any Year issues. Sunbeam expects to complete such contingency plan by September , ;such contingency plan will address alternative processes, such as manualprocedures, electronic spreadsheets, potential alternative service providers,and plans to address Year readiness issues as they arise.THE RISKS OF SUNBEAM\'S YEAR APPROACH The independent consultants assisting the Company in its Year readiness program have reviewed and concurred with the Company\'s approach, haveassisted in developing cost estimates and have monitored costs for the largestsingle component (upgrade or installation of the Company\'s uniform system) ofthe Company\'s Year program. As a result, although the Company did notengage an independent third party to verify the program\'s overall approach ortotal cost, the Company believes that the Company\'s exposure in this regard ismitigated. In addition, through the use of external third-party diagnostic toolswhich helped to identify potential Year issues in one significant businessoperation, the Company believes that it has also mitigated its risk byvalidating and verifying key program components. Management believes that, although there are significant systems thatare being modified or replaced, Sunbeam\'s information systems environment willbe made Year ready prior to January , . Sunbeam\'s failure to timelycomplete such corrective work could have a material adverse impact on theCompany. With respect to customers, suppliers and business partners, the failureof certain of these third parties to become Year ready could also have amaterial adverse impact on Sunbeam. For example, the failure of certain of theCompany\'s principal suppliers to have Year ready internal systems couldimpact the Company\'s ability to manufacture andor ship its products or tomaintain adequate inventory levels for production. At this time, the Company believes that the most likely ""worst-case""scenario relating to Year involves potential disruptions in areas in whichthe Company\'s operations must rely on third parties, such as suppliers, whosesystems may not work properly after January , . While such system failurescould either directly or indirectly affect important operations of the Companyand its subsidiaries in a significant manner, the Company cannot at presentestimate either the likelihood or the potential cost of such failures. Subjectto the nature of the goods or services provided to the Company by third partieswhose operations are not made ready for Year issues, the impact onSunbeam\'s operations could be material if appropriate contingency plans cannotbe developed prior to January , . The nature and focus of the Company\'s efforts to address the Year problem may be revised periodically as interim goals are achieved or new issuesare identified. In addition, it is important to note that the description of theCompany\'s efforts and assessments necessarily involves estimates and projectionswith respect to activities required in the future. These estimates andprojections are subject to change as work continues, and such changes may besubstantial.THE COSTS TO ADDRESS THE COMPANY\'S YEAR ISSUES Through December , , Sunbeam had expended approximately million to address Year issues of which approximately half was recorded ascapital expenditures and the remainder as SG&A expense. Sunbeam\'s currentassessment of the total costs to address and remedy Year issues and enhanceits operating systems, including costs for the acquired companies, isapproximately million. The amount to be incurred for Year issues during of approximately million represents over of the Company\'s total budget for information systems and related support, including Year costs. A large majority of these costs are expected to be incrementalexpenditures that will not recur in the Year or thereafter. Fees andexpenses related to third party consultants, who are involved in the PMO as wellas the modification and replacement of software, represent approximately ofthe total estimated cost. The balance of the total estimated cost relatesprimarily to software license fees and new hardware, but excludes the costsassociated with Company employees. Sunbeam expects these expenditures to befinanced through operating cash flows or borrowings, as applicable. Asignificant portion of these expenditures will enhance Sunbeam\'s operatingsystems in addition to resolving the Year issues. As Sunbeam completes itsassessment of the Year issues, the actual expenditures incurred or to beincurred may differ materially from the amounts shown above. <PAGE> Because Year readiness is critical to the business, Sunbeam hasredeployed some resources from non-critical system enhancements to address Year issues. In addition, due to the importance of IT systems to the Company\'sbusiness, management has deferred non-critical systems enhancements as much aspossible. The Company does not expect these redeployments and deferrals to havea material impact on the Company\'s financial condition, results of operations orcash flows.EFFECTS OF INFLATION For each of the three years in the period ended December , , theCompany\'s cost of raw materials and other product remained relatively stable. Tothe extent possible, the Company\'s objective is to offset the impact ofinflation through productivity enhancements, cost reductions and priceincreases.CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS Certain statements in this Annual Report on Form -K may constitute""forward-looking"" statements within the meaning of the Private SecuritiesLitigation Reform Act of , as the same may be amended from time to time(herein the ""Act"") and in releases made by the SEC from time to time.

OTHER INFORMATION Item ."", 'ITEM . MANAGEMENT\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with theaccompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the relatedfootnotes included in this quarterly report on Form -Q, as well as theconsolidated financial statements, related footnotes and management\'s discussionand analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the Company\'sAnnual Report on Form -K for the year ended December , . ACQUISITIONS On March , , the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary,acquired approximately of the total number of then outstanding shares ofcommon stock of Coleman from an affiliate of M&F, in exchange for ,,shares of the Company\'s common stock and approximately million in cash. Inaddition, the Company assumed approximately , million in debt. Immediatelythereafter, as a result of the exercise of employee stock options, Sunbeam\'sindirect beneficial ownership of Coleman decreased to approximately of thetotal number of the outstanding shares of Coleman common stock. The Company\'sagreement for the acquisition of the remaining publicly held Coleman sharespursuant to a merger transaction provides that the remaining Colemanshareholders will receive approximately . million shares of Sunbeam commonstock (. share for each outstanding Coleman share) and approximately million in cash (. for each outstanding Coleman share and the cash-out ofunexercised Coleman options for an amount equal to the difference between .per share and the exercise price of such options). The Company expects tocomplete the Coleman merger during the second half of , although there canbe no assurance that the merger will occur during that time. On October , , the Company announced that it had entered into aMemorandum of Understanding to settle, subject to Court approval, class actionclaims made by minority shareholders of Coleman relating to the Coleman merger.Under the terms of the proposed settlement, if approved by the Court, theCompany will issue to the Coleman public shareholders, and plaintiff\'s counselin this action, warrants to purchase up to . million shares of the Company\'scommon stock at a cash exercise price of . per share, subject to certainanti-dilution provisions. These warrants would generally have the same terms asthe warrants issued to an affiliate of M&F and will be issued when the Colemanmerger is consummated. Issuance of these warrants will be accounted for asadditional purchase consideration. There can be no assurance that the Court willapprove the settlement as proposed. On April , , the Company completed the cash acquisitions of FirstAlert, a leading manufacturer of smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, andSignature Brands, a leading manufacturer of consumer and professional products.The First Alert and the Signature Brands acquisitions were valued atapproximately million (including million of cash and million ofassumed debt) and million (reflecting cash paid, including the requiredretirement or defeasance of debt), respectively. The acquisitions were recorded under the purchase method of accountingand accordingly, the financial position and results of operations of eachacquired entity are included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statementsfrom the respective dates of acquisition. The purchase prices of the acquiredentities have been allocated to individual assets acquired and liabilitiesassumed based on estimates of fair values (determined by independent appraisals)at the dates of acquisition.THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH , COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH , Results of operations for the three months ended March , includethe results of the three acquired companies for the entire period as compared toresults of operations for the three months ended March , , which onlyincluded the results of Coleman from March , . The acquired entitiesgenerated net sales of . million for the three months ended March , ,with a corresponding gross margin of . million, or . of net sales.Selling, General and Administrative (""SG&A"") costs recorded by the acquiredentities were . million in the period, yielding operating income of .million. Results for the first quarter of included net sales from Colemanof approximately million, with a corresponding gross margin of approximately million, and SG&A expenses of approximately million. For the acquired entities, net sales for the three months ended March, were approximately million higher than their results for the fullfirst quarter a year ago. This increase was attributable to increased net salesat Coleman (approximately million) and Signature Brands (approximately million), partially offset by a decrease in net sales at First Alert(approximately million). Excluding the revenue of Coleman\'s safety andsecurity business and spa business, both of which were sold in , Coleman\'snet sales in the first three months of would have been approximately million higher than the same period in . The increase in Coleman net salesis reflective of strong retail replenishment demand in its outdoor recreationproducts as compared with unusually weak retail replenishment demand in thefirst quarter of . Additionally, increased generator revenues attributableto increased awareness of power shortages from poor weather conditions and otherevents contributed to the higher net sales. Excluding: (i) the effects ofpurchase accounting of approximately million recognized in ; (ii)acquisition costs of approximately million which were incurred in the firstquarter of ; and (iii) approximately million of costs recorded in related to Year compliance efforts, operating profit for these threecompanies improved by approximately million as compared to the same periodin the prior year, resulting primarily from higher net sales and a reduction inexpenses largely attributable to reduced headcount and the centralization ofcertain management and administration functions, resulting from the acquisitionby Sunbeam. <PAGE> Consolidated net sales for the three months ended March , were. million, an increase of . million versus the three months endedMarch , . After excluding . million of net sales generated by theacquired entities in the period and approximately million in the period, as discussed above, net sales of . million decreased approximately from net sales of . million in . The Company believes the decreasein product sales were largely driven by increases in retail inventory levelsfrom channel loading which took place in the first quarter of , but not inthe period. The adverse effect of the channel loading was partiallyoffset by lower estimated provisions for customer returns and customerallowances of approximately million. Domestic sales, excluding the acquired companies, declinedapproximately or million from . The Company believes this salesdecline is attributable to the channel loading that took place in the firstquarter of versus no similar loading in the same period in . Thechannel loading that took place in led to relatively lower sales ofappliances, primarily blenders, breadmakers, handmixers and irons in , aswell as lower sales of outdoor cooking products. Partially offsetting theadverse effects of channel loading was a benefit from reduced costs in fromcustomer returns and allowances. International sales, excluding the acquired companies, represented of net sales for and decreased approximately million as compared withthe net sales for the same period a year ago. The Company believes this salesdecline was largely attributable to the previously discussed impact ofincreasing retail inventory levels in the first quarter of . Sales were alsoadversely impacted in by a decision to stop selling to certain exportdistributors in Latin America. Additionally, poor economic conditions in thatregion contributed to lower sales in . Excluding the effect of the gross margin generated from the inclusionof the acquired entities\' operations of . million in and approximately million in , as discussed above, gross margin was . million or .of sales for versus a gross margin of . million or . of net salesfor . Lower sales volume and unfavorable manufacturing efficienciesresulting from lower production levels in accounted for approximately million of the change between years. This was partially offset by a lowerrelative rate of product returns, reduced customer allowances of approximately million, and improved product mix of approximately million during thefirst quarter of as compared to the same period in . Excluding the effects of: (i) . million of SG&A charges in andapproximately million in resulting from the inclusion of the acquiredentities; (ii) approximately million of compensation expense recordedin connection with new employment agreements with the three former seniorofficers; (iii) a . million benefit in from the reversal of reserves nolonger required, and (iv) . million of costs recorded in the periodrelated to Year compliance efforts, SG&A expenses were approximately .million in the first quarter of , . higher than the same period in .This increase of approximately million is primarily due to an increase incorporate administrative costs of approximately million, reflectingadditional personnel and related relocation, travel and related costs andincreases in postretirement benefit costs. Increases in insurance and highercosts associated with outside services account for the remainder of the increasein SG&A. Operating results for the first quarters of and for theSunbeam business before the acquisitions on a comparable basis as describedabove, were a loss of . million in and a loss of . million in .On the same basis, operating margins as a percent of net sales decreased to aloss of . from a loss of . in the prior year. This change resulted fromthe factors discussed above. Interest expense increased from . million in the first quarter of to . million in the first quarter of primarily related to higherborrowing levels in resulting from borrowings for the acquisitions thatwere outstanding for the entire quarter. Other expense, net of . million for the first three months of included approximately . million relating to liquidating damages expensedrelated to holders of the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Subordinated Debenturesdue (the ""Debentures"") (see Note to the condensed consolidated financialstatements), partially offset by favorable foreign exchange. Other expense, netof . million for the first three months of primarily represents foreignexchange losses, largely arising from Sunbeam\'s operations in Mexico. The minority interest reported in relates to the minority interestheld in Coleman by public shareholders. The Company provided for deferred tax expense in primarily due totaxable income in foreign jurisdictions. Deferred tax assets resulting fromoperating losses, incurred predominantly in domestic jurisdictions, wererecorded and valuation allowances were established for substantially all suchdeferred tax assets. The Company\'s losses and related valuation allowancescaused the reported tax rate to differ from the statutory rate. In , the Company prepaid an industrial revenue bond related to itsHattiesburg facility. In connection with this early extinguishment of debt, theCompany recognized an extraordinary charge of . million, consisting primarilyof redemption premiums.FOREIGN OPERATIONS Approximately of the Company\'s business is conducted in U.S.dollars (including both domestic sales, U.S. dollar denominated export sales,primarily to certain Latin American markets, Asian sales and the majority ofEuropean sales). The Company\'s non-U.S. dollar denominated sales are madeprincipally by subsidiaries in Europe, Canada, Japan, Latin America and Mexico.Mexico reverted to a hyperinflationary status for accounting purposes in ;therefore, translation adjustments related to Mexican net monetary assets wereincluded as a component of net (loss) earnings. Mexico is not consideredhyperinflationary as of January , . This change in <PAGE>Mexico\'s hyperinflationary status is not expected to have a material effect onthe Company\'s financial results. Translation adjustments resulting from theCompany\'s non-U.S. denominated subsidiaries have not had a material impact onthe Company\'s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. While revenues generated in Asia have traditionally not beensignificant, economic instability in this region is expected to have a negativeeffect on earnings. Economic instability and the political environment in LatinAmerica have also affected sales in that region. It is anticipated that sales inand exports to these regions will continue to be impacted so long as theeconomic environments in those regions remain unsettled. On a limited basis, the Company selectively uses derivatives (foreignexchange option and forward contracts) to manage foreign exchange exposures thatarise in the normal course of business. No derivative contracts are entered intofor trading or speculative purposes. The use of derivatives has not had amaterial impact on the Company\'s financial results.SEASONALITY Sunbeam\'s sales, prior to the acquisitions, have not traditionallyexhibited substantial seasonality; however, sales have been strongest during thefourth quarter of the calendar year. Additionally, sales of outdoor cookingproducts are strongest in the first half of the year, while sales of appliances,personal care and blanket products are strongest in the second half of the year.After considering the seasonality of the acquired entities, Sunbeam\'sconsolidated sales are not expected to exhibit substantial seasonality; however,sales are expected to be strongest during the second quarter of the calendaryear. Furthermore, sales of a number of products, including warming blankets,vaporizers, humidifiers, grills, First Alert products, camping and generatorproducts may be impacted by unseasonable weather conditions.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES In order to finance the acquisition of Coleman, First Alert andSignature Brands and to refinance substantially all of the indebtedness of theCompany and the three acquired entities, the Company consummated the offering ofthe Debentures at a yield to maturity of (approximately , millionprincipal amount at maturity) in March , which resulted in approximately million of net proceeds, and entered into the New Credit Facility. The Company was required to file a registration statement with theSecurities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") to register the Debentures by June, . This registration statement was filed on February , and the SEChas not declared the registration statement effective. Sunbeam\'s failure to filethe registration statement by June , did not constitute default under theterms of the Debentures. The Company has filed an amendment to this registrationstatement. From June , until the registration statement is declaredeffective, the Company is required to pay to the Debenture holders cashliquidated damages accruing, for each day during such period, at a rate perannum equal to . during the first days and . thereafter multiplied bythe total of the issue price of the Debentures plus the original issue discountthereon on such day. The Company made its first payment of approximately .million to the Debenture holders on September , and an additional .million was made on March , . Concurrent with the Debenture offering, the Company replaced its million syndicated unsecured five-year revolving credit facility with the NewCredit Facility. The New Credit Facility provided for aggregate borrowings of upto . billion. As a result of its operating losses incurred in fiscal ,among other things, the Company was not in compliance with certain covenants setforth in the New Credit Facility. The Company and its lenders entered intoagreements as of June , , October , and April , , in eachcase providing for waivers of compliance with such covenants and other terms ofthe New Credit Facility. Effective April , , Sunbeam and its lendersentered into an agreement, which waived compliance with such covenants and otherterms through April , and provided for new financial covenants. Thefollowing description of the New Credit Facility reflects the terms of the NewCredit Facility as amended April , . The New Credit Facility provided for aggregate borrowings of up to .billion pursuant to: (i) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principalamount of up to million maturing March , (. million of which mayonly be used to complete the Coleman merger if the Coleman merger is notcompleted prior to August , ); (ii) million in term loans maturing onMarch , (of which . million may only be used to complete the Colemanmerger) and (iii) a million term loan maturing September , . As ofMarch , , approximately . billion was outstanding and . billion wasavailable for borrowing under the New Credit Facility. Pursuant to the New Credit Facility, interest accrues, at the Company\'soption: (i) at the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR""), or (ii) at the baserate of the administrative agent which is generally the higher of the primecommercial lending rate of the administrative agent or the Federal Funds Rateplus ., in each case plus an agreed upon interest margin which is currently. for LIBOR borrowings and . for base rate borrowings. The applicableinterest margin is subject to downward adjustment upon the occurrence of certainevents. Borrowings under the New Credit Facility are secured by a pledge of thestock of the Company\'s material subsidiaries, including Coleman, and by asecurity interest in substantially all of the assets of Sunbeam and its materialdomestic subsidiaries, other than Coleman and its material subsidiaries exceptas described below. Currently, Coleman\'s inventory and related assets arepledged to secure its obligations for letters of credit issued for its accountunder the New Credit Facility. Additionally, as security for Coleman\'s notepayable to the Company, Coleman pledged substantially all of its domesticassets, other than real property, including of the stock of its <PAGE>direct foreign subsidiaries and domestic holding companies for its foreignsubsidiaries, and all of the stock of its other direct domestic subsidiaries(but not the assets of Coleman\'s subsidiaries). The pledge runs in favor ofSunbeam\'s lending banks, to which the Coleman note has been pledged as securityfor Sunbeam\'s obligations to them. Upon completion of the Coleman merger,substantially all of Coleman\'s assets and the assets of Coleman\'s domesticsubsidiaries will be pledged to secure the obligations under the New CreditFacility. In addition, borrowings under the New Credit Facility are guaranteedby a number of the Company\'s wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries andthese subsidiary guarantees are secured as described above. Upon completion ofthe Coleman merger, Coleman and each of its United States subsidiaries willbecome guarantors of the obligations under the New Credit Facility. To theextent borrowings are made by any subsidiaries of the Company, the obligationsof such subsidiaries are guaranteed by the Company. It is an event of default under the New Credit Facility if Sunbeam\'sregistration statement in connection with the Coleman merger is not declaredeffective by the SEC on or before October , or if the merger does notoccur within business days of the effectiveness of the registration statementor if the cash consideration (including any payments on account of the exerciseof any appraisal rights, but excluding related legal, accounting and othercustomary fees and expenses) to consummate the Coleman merger exceeds .million. Although there can be no assurance, the Company anticipates that itwill satisfy these conditions. Unless waived by the bank lenders, the failure tosatisfy these requirements (as with the occurrence of any other event ofdefault) would permit the bank lenders to accelerate the maturity of alloutstanding borrowings under the New Credit Facility. The New Credit Facilityalso includes provisions for the deferral of the scheduled term loanpayments of . million, subject to delivery of certain collateral documentsand the filing of an amendment to the Company\'s registration statement on FormS- relating to the Coleman merger. These conditions have been met and thescheduled loan payments were extended until April , . (See Note of Notesto Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.) As of March , , the Company had cash and cash equivalents of. million, working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents of .million and total debt of . billion. Cash used in operating activities duringthe first quarter of was . million compared to . million in thefirst quarter of . This change is primarily attributable to working capitalimprovements partially offset by lower earnings after giving effect to non-cashcharges. The majority of the working capital improvements are attributable theCompany\'s management of inventory levels and accounts receivable. Inventoriesand receivables increased . million and . million, respectively, in thefirst quarter of as compared to . million and . million,respectively, in the first quarter of . In , the Company built inventorylevels in anticipation of sales volumes that did not materialize and offeredextended credit terms to its customers. The increase in inventory during thefirst quarter of is largely due to the seasonal inventory build in theCompany\'s Outdoor Leisure division. The Company participates in an accountsreceivable securitization program to finance a portion of its accountsreceivable. (See Note of Notes to Condensed Consolidated FinancialStatements.) In the first quarter of , cash used in investing activities wasdriven by capital expenditures of . million, primarily for informationsystems and equipment and tooling for new products. Capital spending in thecomparable period was . million and was primarily for capacityexpansion initiatives, including the Neosho grill manufacturing facility, andequipment and tooling for new products. The new product capital spending in the period principally related to the appliance category and included costsrelated to water and air filtration products, blenders, standmixers and irons.Cash used in investing activities in the first quarter of reflects .million for the acquisition of approximately of Coleman. The Companyanticipates capital spending to be approximately to of net sales,primarily related to information systems and related support, includingexpenditures for Year readiness, new product introductions and capacityadditions. Cash provided by financing activities totaled . million in thefirst quarter of and reflects net borrowings under the Company\'s New CreditFacility. Cash provided by financing activities in the first quarter of was. million and reflects net proceeds from the Debentures of . million,the cancellation and repayment of all outstanding balances under the Company\'s million September revolving credit facility, the repayment of certainColeman debt and the early extinguishment of the . million Hattiesburg bond.In addition, cash provided by financing activities is net of . million offinancing fees related to the Company\'s . billion New Credit Facility and. million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. (See Note to thecondensed consolidated financial statements.) The Company expects to acquire the remaining equity interest in Colemanpursuant to a merger transaction in which the existing Coleman minorityshareholders will receive . share of the Company\'s common stock, . incash for each share of Coleman common stock outstanding and, subject to courtapproval, warrants to purchase common stock of the Company at a cash exerciseprice of . per share. In addition, unexercised options under Coleman\'s stockoption plans will be cashed out at a price per share equal to the differencebetween . and the exercise price of such options. The Company expects toissue approximately . million shares of common stock and expend approximately million in cash, including cash paid to option holders, to complete theColeman transaction. Although there can be no assurance, it is anticipated thatthe Coleman merger will occur in the second half of fiscal . The Company believes its borrowing capacity under the New CreditFacility, cash flow from the combined operations of the Company and its acquiredcompanies, existing cash and cash equivalent balances, and its receivablesecuritization program will be sufficient to support working capital needs,capital and Year compliance spending, and debt service through April ,. The Company intends to negotiate with its lenders on an amendment to theNew Credit Facility, negotiate with its lenders on further waiver of suchcovenants and other terms, or refinance the New Credit Facility. Any decisionswith respect to such amendment, waiver, or refinancing will be made based on areview from time to time of the advisability of particular transactions. Therecan be no assurance that an amendment, further waiver of existing covenants andother terms, or refinancing will be entered into by April , . The failureto obtain such an amendment, further waiver or debt refinancing would likelyresult in violation of the existing covenants and compliance <PAGE>with other terms, which would permit the bank lenders to accelerate the maturityof all outstanding borrowings under the New Credit Facility. Accordingly, debtrelated to the New Credit Facility and all debt containing cross-defaultprovisions will be classified as current in the Condensed Consolidated BalanceSheet in the second quarter of .NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Effective January , , the Company adopted Statement of Position-, ACCOUNTING FOR THE COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPED OR OBTAINED FORINTERNAL USE (""SOP -""). SOP - requires computer software costs associatedwith internal use software to be expensed as incurred until certaincapitalization criteria are met. Adoption of this statement did not have amaterial impact on the Company\'s condensed consolidated financial position,results of operations, or cash flows. In June , the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statementof Financial Accounting Standards No. (""SFAS No. ""), ACCOUNTING FORDERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, which is effective for fiscalyears beginning after June , . SFAS No. requires the recognition ofall derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either assets orliabilities measured at fair value. The Company has not yet determined theimpact SFAS No. will have on its consolidated financial position, results ofoperations, or cash flows.YEAR READINESS DISCLOSURE The Company is preparing for the impact of the Year on itsoperations. Year issues could include potential problems in the informationtechnology (""IT"") and non-IT systems that the Company uses in its operations andproblems in the Company\'s products. Year system failures could affectroutine but critical operations such as forecasting, purchasing, production,order processing, inventory control, shipping, billing and collection. Inaddition, system failures could affect the Company\'s security, payrolloperations, or employee safety. The Company may also be exposed to potentialrisks from third parties with whom the Company interacts who fail to adequatelyaddress their own Year issues.SUNBEAM\'S APPROACH TO YEAR ISSUES While the Company\'s Year readiness planning has been underway forover one year, during the third quarter of the Company established across-functional project team consisting of senior managers, assisted by threeexternal consulting firms which were retained to provide consulting services andto assist the Company in implementing its Year strategy. This team issponsored by the Company\'s Chief Financial Officer who reports directly to theCompany\'s Chief Executive Officer on this issue. The Audit Committee of theBoard of Directors is advised periodically on the status of the Company\'s Year readiness program. The Year project team has developed a phased approach to identifyand resolve Year issues with many of these activities conducted inparallel. The Company\'s approach and the anticipated timing of each phase aredescribed below. PHASE - INVENTORY AND ASSESSMENT: During the first phase of Sunbeam\'sYear readiness program, the Company established a Year ProgramManagement Office (""PMO"") to centralize the management of all of the Company\'sYear projects. Through this office, the Company developed a corporate-wide,uniform strategy for assessing and addressing the Year issues. The Company has completed an inventory of its hardware and softwaresystems, manufacturing equipment, electronic data interchange,telecommunications and other technical assets potentially subject to Year problems, such as security systems and controls for lighting, air conditioning,ventilation and facility access. This inventory was then entered into theCompany\'s Year database along with a determination of the item\'s level ofcriticality to operations. For those inventory items anticipated to have asignificant effect on the business if not corrected, the Company\'s Year program envisions repair or replacement and testing of such items. Allinformation relative to each item is being tracked in the Company\'s Year database. The Company completed most of this phase during the third and fourthquarters of . The Company has completed a review of the readiness ofembedded microprocessors in its products and determined that none of theCompany\'s products have Year date sensitive systems. PHASE - CORRECTION AND TESTING: The second phase of Sunbeam\'s Year readiness program is structured to replace, upgrade or remediate (asnecessary) those items identified during Phase as requiring corrective action. Sunbeam relies on its IT functions to perform many tasks that arecritical to its operations. Significant transactions that could be impacted bynot being ready for any Year issues include, among others, purchases ofmaterials, production management, order entry and fulfillment, and payrollprocessing. Systems and applications that have been identified by Sunbeam todate as not currently Year ready and which are critical to Sunbeam\'soperations include its financial software systems, which process the orderentry, purchasing, production management, general ledger, accounts receivable,and accounts payable functions, payroll applications, and critical applicationsin the Company\'s manufacturing and distribution facilities, such as warehousemanagement applications. In , the Company began implementing a uniforminternational business and accounting information system to improve internalreporting processes. Based upon representations from the manufacturer that thecurrent version of this uniform information system is Year ready, theCompany has been actively upgrading its business sites that currently utilizethis uniform system to the Year ready version. A small number of otherCompany business locations are replacing their current non-Year readysystems with this new uniform system. <PAGE> The Company is also actively replacing andor upgrading legacy businesssystems that are not Year ready, including those that use localizedbusiness system packages which were not candidates to be replaced by the uniformbusiness and accounting information system. With respect to the Company\'s non-ITsystems (for example, time and attendance, security, and in-line manufacturinghardware) the Company is actively analyzing these items to assess any Year issues. To date, no material issues have been discovered, and the Company willcontinue to review, test and correct, if necessary, such items. Sunbeam plans to complete the corrective work described above withrespect to its systems by the second quarter of with final testing andimplementation of such systems occurring in the second and third quarters of. PHASE - CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS: The third phaseof Sunbeam\'s Year readiness program which was initiated during the thirdand fourth quarters of is designed to assess and interact with theCompany\'s customers, suppliers, and business partners. As part of this effort,the Company surveyed , vendors and suppliers determined to be critical tothe Company. Based on the survey, the Company believes that there is only a lowto medium risk of Year issues for approximately three-quarters of itsvendors; however, a small number of vendors have been identified as high risk(less than ) and approximately one-quarter of the vendors did not respondfully to the survey. The Company will continue its vendor evaluation andassessment process through , including direct contact with high and mediumrisk vendors and vendors who have not responded fully to the Company\'s survey.The Company has not independently verified the responses of vendors and does notanticipate undertaking such independent verification process. Beginning in the second quarter of , Sunbeam will also contact itsmajor customers to confirm their preparations for Year issues. The Companyhas already responded to numerous customer inquiries and believes that all ofthe Company\'s major customers have established programs to deal with Year issues. In order to improve the Company\'s communication with its customers,suppliers and business partners, the Company has set up a Sunbeam Year telephone number and is in the process of providing Year information on aCompany web site. PHASE - CONTINGENCY PLANNING: This phase will involve contingencyplanning for unresolved Year issues, particularly any issues arising withthird party suppliers. The Company\'s Year readiness program is ongoing andits ultimate scope, as well as the consideration of contingency plans, willcontinue to be evaluated as new information becomes available. As aprecautionary measure, Sunbeam plans to establish a contingency plan foraddressing any effects of the Year on its operations, whether due toSunbeam\'s systems or those of third parties not being ready for any Year issues. Sunbeam expects to complete such contingency plan by September , ;such contingency plan will address alternative processes, such as manualprocedures, electronic spreadsheets, potential alternative service providers,and plans to address Year readiness issues as they arise.THE RISKS OF SUNBEAM\'S YEAR APPROACH The independent consultants assisting the Company in its Year readiness program have reviewed and concurred with the Company\'s approach, haveassisted in developing cost estimates and have monitored costs for the largestsingle component (upgrade or installation of the Company\'s uniform system) ofthe Company\'s Year program. As a result, although the Company did notengage an independent third party to verify the program\'s overall approach ortotal cost, the Company believes that the Company\'s exposure in this regard ismitigated. In addition, through the use of external third-party diagnostic toolswhich helped to identify potential Year issues in one significant businessoperation, the Company believes that it has also mitigated its risk byvalidating and verifying key program components. Management believes that, although there are significant systems thatare being modified or replaced, Sunbeam\'s information systems environment willbe made Year ready prior to January , . Sunbeam\'s failure to timelycomplete such corrective work could have a material adverse impact on theCompany. With respect to customers, suppliers and business partners, the failureof certain of these third parties to become Year ready could also have amaterial adverse impact on Sunbeam. For example, the failure of certain of theCompany\'s principal suppliers to have Year ready internal systems couldimpact the Company\'s ability to manufacture andor ship its products or tomaintain adequate inventory levels for production. At this time, the Company believes that the most likely ""worst-case""scenario relating to Year involves potential disruptions in areas in whichthe Company\'s operations must rely on third parties, such as suppliers, whosesystems may not work properly after January , . While such system failurescould either directly or indirectly affect important operations of the Companyand its subsidiaries in a significant manner, the Company cannot at presentestimate either the likelihood or the potential cost of such failures. Subjectto the nature of the goods or services provided to the Company by third partieswhose operations are not made ready for Year issues, the impact onSunbeam\'s operations could be material if appropriate contingency plans cannotbe developed prior to January , . The nature and focus of the Company\'s efforts to address the Year problem may be revised periodically as interim goals are achieved or new issuesare identified. In addition, it is important to note that the description of theCompany\'s efforts and assessments necessarily involves estimates and projectionswith respect to activities required in the future. These estimates andprojections are subject to change as work continues, and such changes may besubstantial. <PAGE>THE COSTS TO ADDRESS THE COMPANY\'S YEAR ISSUES During the quarter ended March , , Sunbeam had expendedapproximately million to address Year issues of which approximately was recorded as capital expenditures and the remainder as SG&A expense.Sunbeam\'s current assessment of the total costs to address and remedy Year issues and enhance its operating systems, including costs for the acquiredcompanies, is approximately million. The amount to be incurred for Year issues during of approximately million represents over of theCompany\'s total budget for information systems and related support,including Year costs. A large majority of these costs are expected to beincremental expenditures that will not recur in the Year or thereafter.Fees and expenses related to third party consultants, who are involved in thePMO as well as the modification and replacement of software, representapproximately of the total estimated cost. The balance of the totalestimated cost relates primarily to software license fees and new hardware, butexcludes the costs associated with Company employees. Sunbeam expects theseexpenditures to be financed through operating cash flows or borrowings, asapplicable. A significant portion of these expenditures will enhance Sunbeam\'soperating systems in addition to resolving the Year issues. As Sunbeamcompletes its assessment of the Year issues, the actual expendituresincurred or to be incurred may differ materially from the amounts shown above. Because Year readiness is critical to the business, Sunbeam hasredeployed some resources from non-critical system enhancements to address Year issues. In addition, due to the importance of IT systems to the Company\'sbusiness, management has deferred non-critical systems enhancements as much aspossible. The Company does not expect these redeployments and deferrals to havea material impact on the Company\'s financial condition, results of operations,or cash flows.CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form -Q may constitute""forward-looking"" statements within the meaning of the Private SecuritiesLitigation Reform Act of , as the same may be amended from time to time(herein the ""Act"") and in releases made by the SEC from time to time.

OTHER INFORMATION Item ."", 'ITEM . MANAGEMENT\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with theaccompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the relatedfootnotes included in this quarterly report on Form -Q, as well as theconsolidated financial statements, related footnotes and management\'s discussionand analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the Company\'sAnnual Report on Form -K for the year ended December , .ACQUISITIONS On March , , the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary,acquired approximately of the total number of then outstanding shares ofcommon stock of Coleman from a subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes (""M&F""), inexchange for ,, shares of the Company\'s common stock and approximately million in cash. In addition, the Company assumed approximately ,million in debt. Immediately thereafter, as a result of the exercise of Colemanemployee stock options, Sunbeam\'s indirect beneficial ownership of Colemandecreased to approximately of the total number of the outstanding shares ofColeman common stock. The Company\'s agreement for the acquisition of theremaining publicly held Coleman shares pursuant to a merger transaction providesthat the remaining Coleman shareholders will receive: o approximately . million shares of Sunbeam common stock (. of a share for each outstanding Coleman share); and, o approximately million in cash (. for each outstanding Coleman share and the cash-out of unexercised Coleman employee stock options for an amount equal to the difference between . per share and the exercise price of such options). The Company expects to complete the Coleman merger during the secondhalf of , although there can be no assurance that the merger will occurduring that time. See Note to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statementsfor information regarding the settlement claims relating to the Colemanacquisition, the terms of which provide for the issuance at the time of themerger of warrants to purchase up to . million shares of Sunbeam\'s commonstock at per share. On April , , the Company completed the cash acquisitions of FirstAlert, a leading manufacturer of smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, andSignature Brands, a leading manufacturer of consumer and professional products.The First Alert and the Signature Brands acquisitions were valued atapproximately million (including million of cash and million ofassumed debt) and approximately million (reflecting cash paid, includingthe required retirement or defeasance of debt), respectively. The acquisitions were recorded under the purchase method of accountingand accordingly, the financial position and results of operations of eachacquired entity are included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statementsfrom the respective dates of acquisition. The purchase prices of the acquiredentities have been allocated to individual assets acquired and liabilitiesassumed based on estimates of fair values determined by independent appraisalsat the dates of acquisition. <PAGE> CHARGES Consolidated operating results for were impacted by a number oflargely non-recurring charges. Operating income, adjusted for these items, issummarized in the following table and succeeding narrative.<TABLE><CAPTION> AS REPORTED COMBINED ------------------------------------------------------ HISTORICAL THREE MONTHS ENDED SIX MONTHS ENDED RESULTS ---------------------- ------------------------- SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE , JUNE , JUNE , JUNE , JUNE , -------- -------- ---------- -------- ----------<S> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C>(Amounts in millions)Net sales - As reported ........... . . ,. . ,.Gross margin - As reported ........ .

The combined historical results do not include pro forma purchaseaccounting adjustments including those relating to the amortization of thepurchase price of these acquisitions. Presentation of these combined historicalresults is to enhance comparability between the periods presented and notnecessarily indicative of the combined results that would have occurred hadthese acquisitions been consummated at the beginning of .Provision For Inventory- ----------------------- In the second quarter of , the Company recorded a charge of .million as a result of the following: o Inventories were built during and the first half of in anticipation of sales volumes which did not materialize. As a result, it has been and will continue to be necessary to dispose of some portions of excess inventories at amounts less than cost. Accordingly, in the second quarter of , when the facts and circumstances were known that such sales volume would not materialize, the Company recorded . million in charges to properly state this inventory at the lower-of-cost-or-market. This inventory primarily related to certain appliances, grills and grill accessories. o A charge of . million was recorded during the second quarter of for excess inventories for raw material and work in process that will not be used due to outsourcing the production of breadmakers, toasters, and certain other appliances. o In the second quarter of , the Company made the decision to exit certain product lines, primarily air and water filtration products and eliminate certain stock keeping units (""SKU\'s"") within existing product lines, primarily relating to appliances, grills and grill accessories. As a result of this decision, a . million charge was recorded during the second quarter of to properly state this inventory at the lower-of-cost-or market. These charges to record excess inventories at thelower-of-cost-or-market were based upon management\'s best estimate of netrealizable value. (See Note to the Condensed Consolidated FinancialStatements.) <PAGE> In addition to the charge taken in , the excess and obsoleteinventory referenced above has impacted the Company\'s operating results inseveral ways, with two primary effects. First, gross margins have been impactedby sales, at below normal prices, of obsolete inventory into non-traditionalchannels and excess inventory into traditional channels. In addition, due to thehigh levels of excess inventory at the end of , the Company\'s usage of itsmanufacturing facilities has been lower than normal, resulting in lower grossmargins in .Asset Impairment- ---------------- Management made decisions to outsource or discontinue a substantialnumber of products previously made by the Company (principally breadmakers,toasters and certain other appliances, air and water filtration products and theelimination of certain SKU\'s within existing product lines, primarily relatingto appliances, grills and grill accessories). As a result, certain facilitiesand equipment would either no longer be used or would be utilized in asignificantly different manner. Accordingly, a charge of . million wasrecorded in Cost of Goods Sold to write certain of these assets down to theirestimated fair market value. (See Note to the Condensed Consolidated FinancialStatements.)Purchase Accounting- ------------------- The Company recorded the acquisitions using the purchase method ofaccounting. In accordance with this accounting method, inventory pertaining tothe acquisitions was recorded at fair value. The fair value of the inventoryexceeded the book value reflected on the balance sheets of the acquiredcompanies as of the respective acquisition dates. The excess of the fair valueof inventory over its pre-acquisition book value was recorded in cost of salesas the inventory was sold. The adjustment above removes this non-recurringimpact (. million).Former Employees\' Deferred Compensation- --------------------------------------- On February , , the Company entered into new three-yearemployment agreements with its then Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and twoother senior officers of the Company. The new employment agreements providedfor, among other items, the acceleration of vesting of restricted stock and theforfeiture of unvested restricted stock that had been granted under theexecutives\' prior employment agreements, new restricted stock grants and optionsto purchase common shares. Total compensation expense recognized in the firstquarter of related to these items was approximately million. (See Note to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.)THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE , COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE , Consolidated net sales for the three months ended June , and were . million and . million respectively, an increase of .million or approximately . This increase was driven primarily by the OutdoorLeisure group where net sales increased . million to . million in thesecond quarter of . This increase was predominately driven by strong retailreplenishment demand of outdoor recreation products and Powermate(R) generators(aggregating approximately million). The increase in outdoor recreationproducts and Powermate(R) generators is believed to be partially attributable toheightened consumer sensitivity to the need for emergency preparedness. Thisincreased sensitivity is believed to be reflective of a combination of factorsincluding weather conditions and Year considerations. Outdoor cookingproduct net sales increased approximately million in the period ascompared to the second quarter of , largely as a result of reduced shipmentsin the year ago quarter to allow trade inventories to return to appropriatelevels. This factor affects the year to year comparisons for each of theoperating groups. These improvements were partially offset by weaknesses in netsales of Eastpak(R) products. Household net sales increased . million to. million in . Despite the lack of significant new productintroductions, overall net sales of appliances, personal care, and healthproducts increased approximately million as a result of a strengtheningretail environment in the current year and the effect of reduced shipments inthe year ago quarter. During sales of coffee makers and smoke and carbonmonoxide detectors were adversely effected by the disruption that arose from theintegration with Sunbeam and the related management changes. Results for thesecond quarter of reflect improvement in the sales of coffee makers andsmoke and carbon monoxide detectors (approximately million) from the prioryear quarter, accounting for the remaining increase. International net salesincreased . million to . million. The increase in net sales was largelydriven by improved net sales in Canada of approximately million, resultingpredominantly from strong retail demand for Powermate(R) and outdoor recreationproducts and the effect of reduced shipments in the year ago quarter, asdiscussed above. In addition, net sales increased in Europe and Japan byapproximately million in the second quarter of as compared to the sameperiod in , partially offset <PAGE>by declining net sales of the Company\'s products in Latin America. The Companybelieves that weak economic conditions contributed to the decline in LatinAmerican net sales. Gross margin for the second quarter in was . million or. million higher than the comparable period in . Excluding the effectsof non-recurring adjustments, as summarized above under "" Charges"",gross margin for was . million in the second quarter of . As apercentage of net sales, gross margin improved to approximately in thesecond quarter of as compared to the second quarter gross margin ofnegative and adjusted gross margin of approximately . The threeoperating groups contributed nearly equally to the margin improvements in the period. Approximately half of the Outdoor Leisure group\'s marginimprovement resulted from additional volume and an improved product mix with theremaining improvement resulting from favorable overhead absorption as a resultof higher manufacturing volumes. The improvement in the Household group wasdriven by appliances and personal care products which benefited from improvedmanufacturing efficiencies and cost benefits achieved from sourcing additionalfinished goods from third party vendors. Approximately of the improvement inthe International group\'s gross margin resulted from the benefit of the shutdown of the Mexico City manufacturing facility which had experienced highmaterial usage costs and employee benefit costs in the second quarter a yearago. The remaining improvement in the International group resulted from grossmargin generated by higher sales volumes and a lower level of product returns. SG&A expense in the second quarter of was . million,representing an . increase over the same period in the prior year. Excludingthe effect of Year compliance efforts (. million) recorded in the secondquarter of , SG&A expense increased approximately million (approximately) in as compared to the same period in . This increase is largelyattributable to higher levels of selling and administrative costs primarily inthe Outdoor Leisure and International segments driven by increased net sales. Inaddition, SG&A expense in the second quarter of reflects costs associatedwith certain redundant operations resulting from the Company\'s acquisitionsand the decision to bring in-house certain operating activities that arecurrently outsourced. The Company is in the process of fully integrating certainof these functions and expects that when this process has been completedconsolidated SG&A expense for these functions will be reduced. Consolidated operating results for the second quarters of and, were a profit of . million in and a loss of . million in. Operating results for the second quarter of , as adjusted, were a lossof . million. This change resulted from the factors discussed above. Interest expense in the second quarter of was . million ascompared to . million in the same period in the prior year. Approximatelyhalf of this increase is attributable to higher levels of borrowings during thesecond quarter of . The increased level of borrowings was attributable tocapital expenditures since the second quarter of . The balance of theincrease was driven by the impact of higher interest rates during the period and the amortization of the loan commitment fee (approximately million) the Company is obligated to pay under the terms of the New CreditFacility. See Note to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for adiscussion of the loan commitment fee. Other expense, net of . million for the second quarter of included approximately million relating to the bank credit facility and thedebentures. The increased credit facility expenses primarily related to unusedfacility fees and the debenture expense related to liquidated damages payable todebenture holders. (See Note to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.)Other expense, net of . million for the second quarter of primarilyrepresents foreign exchange losses principally at the Company\'s operations inMexico, Venezuela and Canada. Other expense for this period also includesapproximately . million related to unused facility fees. Expenses during thesecond quarter of and were partially offset by interest income of .million and . million, respectively. The minority interest reported for the second quarter of and relates to the minority interest held in Coleman by public shareholders. Approximately million of the . million income tax expenserecorded in the second quarter of related to a U.S. tax liability generatedby Coleman as a separate U.S. tax filing entity. As discussed below, in July, the Company acquired a sufficient ownership interest in Coleman to permitit and Coleman to file consolidated U.S. tax returns with Coleman for all futureperiods. The remaining tax expense recorded in the second quarter of related to taxes on foreign income. Tax expense recorded for the second quarterof was nearly all related to foreign taxes. No net tax benefit was recordedon the Company\'s losses in either year as it is management\'s assessment that theCompany cannot demonstrate that it is more likely than not that deferred taxassets resulting from these losses would be realized through future taxableincome. <PAGE> On July , , the Company acquired ,, shares of a newlycreated series of Coleman voting preferred stock for an aggregate purchase priceof approximately million. These shares, together with the shares of Colemancommon stock the Company owns, enable Sunbeam to exercise . of the totalvoting power of Coleman\'s outstanding capital stock as of July , . Thisclass of preferred stock was created by Coleman and acquired by the Company inorder to enable Coleman and the Company to file consolidated federal income taxreturns, and in certain jurisdictions, consolidated state income tax returns,prior to the consummation of the Coleman merger. In connection with the issuanceof the shares of preferred stock, the Company entered into a tax sharingagreement with Coleman, pursuant to which Coleman will pay to Sunbeam amountsequal to the federal and state income taxes that would have been payable byColeman had Coleman not been included in the consolidated income tax return ofthe Company. The net proceeds of preferred stock were used by Coleman to make apartial repayment on the note payable to Sunbeam. (See Note to the CondensedConsolidated Financial Statements.) As a result of repayment of certain indebtedness assumed in the Colemanacquisition, the Company recognized an extraordinary charge in the secondquarter of . The debt assumed in connection with the Coleman acquisition wasrepaid as a result of the requirements under the terms of the New CreditFacility. This extraordinary charge consisted of redemption premiums (.million), unamortized debt discount (. million) and unamortized deferredfinancing costs (. million) and was net of income taxes (. million). (SeeNote to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.)SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE , COMPARED TO SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE , Net sales for the six months ended June , and were ,.million and . million respectively, an increase of . million. Resultsfor the six months ended June , include Coleman, Signature Brands andFirst Alert from their respective acquisition dates. After adjusting salesto include sales of the acquired companies for the periods from the beginning of through the respective dates of acquisition, combined historical net saleswould be ,. million. net sales increased approximately million orapproximately over combined historical net sales. Information thatadjusts for the results of the acquisitions prior to the actual acquisitiondates (the ""combined historical"" information) is provided for informationalpurposes only and is to enhance comparability of the period presented. Thisinformation is not necessarily indicative of what the combined results wouldhave been had these acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the periodspresented. The increase in net sales is driven by the Outdoor Leisure groupwhich had an increase of approximately million in as compared to thecombined historical net sales in the same period in the prior year. Thisincrease over combined historical net sales was largely due to sales of outdoorrecreation products and Powermate(R) generators. The higher level of sales ofthese products is believed to be partially attributable to heightened consumersensitivity to the need for emergency preparedness. The Company believes thatthis heightened sensitivity is reflective of a combination of factors, includingweather conditions and Year considerations. Household net sales in decreased approximately million compared to combined historical netsales. The Company believes that the channel loading that took place in thefirst quarter of was primarily responsible for this decrease. Internationalnet sales in increased . million over combined historical netsales. Higher sales in Canada and Europe resulted predominantly from strongretail demand of Powermate(R) and outdoor recreation products. This increase waspartially offset by the impact of weak economic conditions in Latin America. Gross margin for the first half of was . million or .million higher than the comparable period in . Adjusting for the combinedresults of the acquired companies and excluding the effects of non-recurring adjustments, which are summarized above under the heading ""Charges"", gross margin for the first half of increased approximately million over the combined historical gross margin, with each of theoperating groups contributing to the margin improvement. As a percentage of netsales, gross margin improved to approximately in the first half of ascompared to a negative in the first half of . The gross margin percentagefor the period adjusted for the non-recurring charges and for the effect ofthe acquired companies was approximately of combined historical net sales.The Household group contributed approximately million of the grossmargin improvement over the combined historical gross margin. Theimprovement in the Household group\'s gross margin resulted primarily fromimproved manufacturing processes and controls and reduced sales returns andallowances. The Outdoor Leisure group\'s gross margin in improved byapproximately million over combined historical gross margin.Approximately of the improvement in the Outdoor Leisure group\'s gross marginresulted from additional volume and improved mix. The remaining improvementresulted from improved manufacturing overhead absorption. The Internationalgroup contributed approximately million of the gross margin improvementover combined historical gross margin. Approximately of the improvementin the International group\'s gross margin resulted from the shut down of theMexico City manufacturing facility which had experienced high material usagecosts and employee benefit costs in the prior year. The remaining improvementresulted from a lower level of product returns. <PAGE> SG&A expense for the first six months of was . million, anincrease of . million or . over the same period in the prior year. Afteradjusting SG&A expense to include the acquired companies\' SG&A expense forthe period from the beginning of through the respective dates ofacquisition (. million), combined historical SG&A expense was .million. Since the combined historical SG&A expenses were derived by addingthe acquired companies\' pre-acquisition period costs to the reported six months\'results of Sunbeam, the combined historical SG&A expenses include . millionof amortization of intangibles expense representing both pre- andpost-acquisition periods, as well as approximately million of transactioncosts incurred by the acquired companies relating the them being purchased bySunbeam. Excluding these costs, and the non-recurring charges of .million, as described above under "" Charges"", adjusted SG&A expenseswere approximately million. The SG&A expenses included . millionof amortization of intangibles expense and . million of costs for Year compliance efforts. Excluding these costs, the adjusted SG&A costs were. million, nearly flat with a year ago. Operating results for the first halves of and , were a loss of. million in and a loss of . million in . Adjusted for thehistorical results of the acquired companies and excluding non-recurringcharges, as previously described, operating results for the and periods were losses of . million and . million, respectively. This changeresulted from the factors discussed above. Interest expense increased from . million in the first half of to . million in the first half of . Nearly all of the change related tohigher borrowing levels in resulting primarily from borrowings for theacquisitions that were outstanding for the entire six month period ascompared to only a portion of the period. Other expense, net of . million for the first half of includedapproximately million relating to the bank credit facility and thedebentures. The credit facility expenses primarily related to unused facilityfees and the debenture expense related to liquidated damages payable todebenture holders. (See Note to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.)Other expense, net of . million for the first half of primarilyrepresented foreign exchange losses principally at the Company\'s operations inMexico, Venezuela and Canada. Other expense for this period also includesapproximately . million relating to an unused facility fee. Expenses duringboth periods were partially offset by interest income of . million. The minority interest reported in and relates to the minorityinterest held in Coleman by public shareholders. Approximately million of the . million income tax expenserecorded in related to a U.S. tax liability generated by Coleman as aseparate U.S. tax filing entity. As previously discussed, in July , theCompany acquired a sufficient ownership interest in Coleman to permit it to fileconsolidated U.S. tax returns with Coleman for all future periods. The remainingtax expense recorded in related to taxes on foreign income. Tax expenserecorded in was nearly all related to foreign taxes. No net tax benefit wasrecorded on the Company\'s losses in either year as it is management\'s assessmentthat the Company cannot demonstrate that it is more likely than not thatdeferred tax assets resulting from these losses would be realized through futuretaxable income. In March , the Company prepaid a . million . industrialrevenue bond related to its Hattiesburg facility originally due in . Inconnection with the early extinguishment of this debt, the Company recognized anextraordinary charge in the first quarter of . As a result of repayment ofcertain indebtedness assumed in the Coleman acquisition, the Company alsorecognized and extraordinary charge in the second quarter of . The debtassumed in connection with the Coleman acquisition was repaid as a result of therequirements under the terms of the New Credit Facility. These extraordinarycharges consisted of redemption premiums (. million), unamortized debtdiscount (. million) and unamortized deferred financing costs (. million)and were net of income taxes (. million).FOREIGN OPERATIONS Approximately of the Company\'s business is conducted in U.S.dollars (including both domestic sales, U.S. dollar denominated export sales,primarily to certain Latin American markets, Asian sales and the majority ofEuropean sales). The Company\'s non-U.S. dollar denominated sales are madeprincipally by subsidiaries in Europe, Canada, Japan, Latin America and Mexico.Mexico reverted to a hyperinflationary status for accounting purposes in ;therefore, translation adjustments related to Mexican net monetary assets wereincluded as a component of net (loss) earnings. Mexico is not consideredhyperinflationary as of January , . This change in Mexico\'shyperinflationary status is not expected to have a material effect on theCompany\'s financial results. Translation adjustments resulting from theCompany\'s non-U.S. <PAGE>denominated subsidiaries have not had a material impact on the Company\'sfinancial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. While revenues generated in Asia have traditionally not beensignificant, economic instability in this region is expected to have a negativeeffect on earnings. Economic instability and the political environment in LatinAmerica have also affected sales in that region. It is anticipated that sales inand exports to these regions will continue to be impacted so long as theeconomic environments in those regions remain unsettled. On a limited basis, the Company selectively uses derivatives (foreignexchange option and forward contracts) to manage foreign exchange exposures thatarise in the normal course of business. No derivative contracts are entered intofor trading or speculative purposes. The use of derivatives has not had amaterial impact on the Company\'s financial results.SEASONALITY Sunbeam\'s consolidated sales are not expected to exhibit substantialseasonality; however, sales are expected to be strongest during the secondquarter of the calendar year. Furthermore, sales of a number of products,including warming blankets, vaporizers, humidifiers, grills, First Alertproducts, camping and generator products may be impacted by unseasonable weatherconditions.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESDEBT INSTRUMENTS In order to finance the acquisition of Coleman, First Alert andSignature Brands and to refinance substantially all of the indebtedness of theCompany and the three acquired companies, the Company consummated an offering inMarch of zero coupon debentures having a yield to maturity of , whichresulted in approximately million of net proceeds and borrowed about ,million under its new bank credit facility. The debentures are exchangeable for shares of the Company \'s commonstock at an initial conversion rate of . shares for each , principalamount at maturity of the debentures, subject to adjustments upon occurrence ofspecified events. The debentures are subordinated in right of payment to allexisting and future senior indebtedness of the Company. The debentures are notredeemable by the Company prior to March , . On or after such date, thedebentures are redeemable for cash with at least days notice, at the optionof the Company. The Company is required to purchase debentures at the option ofthe holder as of March , , March , and March , , at purchaseprices equal to the issue price plus accrued original discount to such dates.Sunbeam may, at its option, elect to pay any such purchase price in cash orcommon stock or any combination thereof. However, the bank credit facilityprohibits the Company from redeeming or repurchasing debentures for cash. TheCompany was required to file a registration statement with the SEC to registerthe debentures by June , . This registration statement was filed onFebruary , and the SEC has not declared the registration statementeffective. The Company \'s failure to file the registration statement by June , did not constitute default under the terms of the debentures. As part ofthe normal review process by the SEC, a number of comments have been made by thestaff of the Division of Corporation Finance relating to the registrationstatement and the restated and financial statements included therein.The Company has filed amendments to this registration statement. From June , until the registration statement is declared effective, the Company isrequired to pay to the debenture holders cash liquidated damages accruing, foreach day during such period, at a rate per annum equal to . during the first days and . thereafter multiplied by the total of the issue price of thedebentures plus the original issue discount thereon on such day. The Companymade its first payment of approximately , to the debenture holders onSeptember , and an additional million was paid on March , . Anadditional cash payment of approximately million, representing the Company\'sliability to debenture holders through June , , will be due on September, . Concurrent with the acquisitions, the Company replaced its millionsyndicated unsecured five-year revolving credit facility with the bank creditfacility. The bank credit facility provided for aggregate borrowings of up to. billion and in addition to other customary covenants, required the Companyto maintain specified consolidated leverage, interest coverage and fixed chargecoverage ratios as of the end of each fiscal quarter occurring after March , and on or prior to the latest stated maturity date for any of theborrowings under the bank credit facility. <PAGE> As a result of, among other things, its operating losses incurredduring the first half of , the Company did not achieve the specifiedfinancial ratios for June , and it appeared unlikely that the Companywould achieve the specified financial ratios for September , .Consequently, the Company and its lenders entered into an agreement dated as ofJune , that waived through December , all defaults arising fromthe failure of the Company to satisfy the specified financial ratios for June, and September , . Pursuant to an agreement with the Company datedas of October , , the Company \'s lenders extended all of the waivers underthe June agreement through April , and also waived through such dateall defaults arising from any failure by the Company to satisfy the specifiedfinancial ratios for December , . As part of the October , agreement, the Company agreed to a minimum monthly earnings before interest,taxes, depreciation and amortization (""EBITDA"") covenant (as defined in the bankcredit facility) which covenant the Company had been able to satisfy. On April , , among other things, the lenders extended all of thewaivers set forth in the October , agreement through April , . OnApril , , the Company and its lenders entered into a comprehensiveamendment to the bank credit facility that, among other things, extended all ofthe waivers under the April , agreement until April , and waiveduntil such date all defaults arising from any failure by the Company to satisfythe specified financial ratios for any fiscal quarter end occurring during and for March , . Following is a description of the significant terms ofthe bank credit facility as amended April , . As part of the April , bank credit facility amendment, the Company agreed to a minimum cumulativeEBITDA covenant that is based on post-December , consolidated EBITDA andis tested at the end of each month occurring on or prior to March , , aswell as a covenant limiting the amount of revolving loans (other than those usedto fund the Coleman merger) that may be outstanding under the bank creditfacility as of the end of each such month. The minimum cumulative EBITDA wasinitially . million for the period January , through April , andgenerally grows on a monthly basis until it reaches . million for theperiod from January , through March , . The bank credit facility provides for aggregate borrowings of up to. billion through: o a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to . million maturing March , , . million of which may only be used to complete the Coleman merger if the Coleman merger is not completed prior to August , ; o up to . million in term loans maturing on March , , of which . million may only be used to complete the Coleman merger; and o a . million term loan maturing September , , of which . million has already been repaid through June , . As of June , , approximately . billion was outstanding andapproximately . billion was available for borrowing under the bank creditfacility. The remaining . billion of the . billion bank credit facilitywas committed for outstanding letters of credit. Under the bank credit facility, interest accrues, at the Company \'soption: o at the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR""); o or at the base rate of the administrative agent which is generally the higher of the prime commercial lending rate of the administrative agent or the Federal Funds Rate plus .;in each case plus an interest margin which is currently . for LIBORborrowings and . for base rate borrowings. The applicable interest margin issubject to downward or upward adjustment upon the occurrence of specified eventsincluding a . increase on September , if the Coleman merger has notoccurred by then and an additional . to . increase on October , ifthe Coleman merger has not occurred by then. Borrowings under the bank credit facility are secured by a pledge ofthe stock of the Company\'s material subsidiaries, including Coleman, and by asecurity interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company and itsmaterial domestic subsidiaries, other than Coleman and its material subsidiariesexcept as described below. Currently, Coleman\'s inventory and related assets arepledged to secure its obligations for letters of credit issued for its accountunder the bank credit facility. Additionally, as security for Coleman\'s notepayable to the Company, Coleman pledged substantially all of its domesticassets, other than real property, including of the stock of its directforeign subsidiaries and domestic holding companies for its foreign subsidiariesand all of the stock of its other direct domestic subsidiaries but not theassets of Coleman\'s subsidiaries. The pledge runs in favor of the Company \'slending banks, to <PAGE>which the Coleman note has been pledged as security for the Company \'sobligations to them. Upon completion of the Coleman merger, substantially all ofColeman\'s assets and the assets of Coleman\'s domestic subsidiaries will bepledged to secure the obligations under the bank credit facility. In addition, borrowings under the bank credit facility are guaranteedby a number of the Company \'s wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries andthese subsidiary guarantees are secured as described above. Upon completion ofthe Coleman merger, Coleman and each of its United States subsidiaries willbecome guarantors of the obligations under the bank credit facility. To theextent extensions of credit are made to any subsidiaries of the Company, theobligations of such subsidiaries are guaranteed by the Company. In addition to the above described financial ratios and tests, the bankcredit facility contains covenants customary for credit facilities of a similarnature, including limitations on the ability of the Company and itssubsidiaries, including Coleman, to, among other things: o declare dividends or repurchase stock; o prepay, redeem or repurchase debt, incur liens and engage in sale-leaseback transactions; o make loans and investments; o incur additional debt (including revolving loans under the bank credit facility); o amend or otherwise alter material agreements or enter into restrictive agreements; o make capital and Year compliance expenditures; o engage in mergers, acquisitions and asset sales; o engage in transactions with specified affiliates; o settle specified litigation; o alter its cash management system; and o alter the businesses they conduct.Sunbeam is also required to comply with specified financial covenants andratios. The bank credit facility provides for events of default customary fortransactions of this type, including nonpayment, misrepresentation, breach ofcovenant, cross-defaults, bankruptcy, material adverse change arising fromcompliance with ERISA, material adverse judgments, entering into guarantees andchange of ownership and control. It is also an event of default under the bankcredit facility if the Company \'s registration statement in connection with theColeman merger is not declared effective by the SEC on or before October , or if the merger does not occur within business days of theeffectiveness of the registration statement or if the cashconsideration--including any payments on account of the exercise of anyappraisal rights, but excluding related legal, accounting and other customaryfees and expenses--to consummate the Coleman merger exceeds . million.Although there can be no assurance, the Company anticipates that it will satisfythese conditions. Furthermore, the bank credit facility requires the Company toprepay term loans under the bank credit facility on each of September , and December , to the extent that cash on hand in the Company \'sconcentration accounts plus the aggregate amount of unused revolving loancommitments on these dates (excluding, for the September measurement date, .million reserved for the Coleman merger), exceeds million and million,respectively, but the Company is not required to prepay more than . millionin the aggregate as a result of the provision. Unless waived by the bank lenders, the failure of the Company tosatisfy any of the financial ratios and tests contained in the bank creditfacility or the occurrence of any other event of default under the bank creditfacility would entitle the bank lenders to (a) receive a . increase in theinterest rate applicable to outstanding loans and increase the trade letter ofcredit fees to . and (b) accelerate the maturity of the outstandingborrowings under the bank credit facility and exercise all or any of their otherrights and remedies. Any such acceleration or other exercise of rights andremedies would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company. The bank credit facility also includes provisions for the deferral ofthe scheduled term loan payments of . million until April , as aresult of the satisfaction by the Company on May , of the agreed uponconditions to the deferral. See Note to the Condensed Consolidated FinancialStatements.CASH FLOWS As of June , , the Company had cash and cash equivalents of .million and total debt of . billion. Because the waivers granted by theCompany\'s lenders expire on April , , the borrowings under the bank creditfacility, as well as other debt containing cross-default provisions, areclassified as short-term in the June , <PAGE>Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Cash used in operating activities duringthe first half of was . million compared to . million in the firsthalf of . This change is primarily attributable to working capitalimprovements and improved operating results. The majority of the working capitalimprovements are attributable to the Company\'s management of inventory levels.Inventories generated approximately million of additional cash flow versusthe same period in the prior year. The inventory change in the periodreflects inventory changes of the acquired companies from their respective datesof acquisition. Increases in accounts payable generated approximately million of cash in the first six months of whereas payables usedapproximately million in the same period of , resulting in animprovement in cash flow period-to-period of approximately million. Theincrease in payables in the current period resulted from payables balanceshaving been reduced to a low level by year-end . This reduction in payables,which included an effort to reduce delinquent payables, began in the secondquarter of . These cash flow improvements are partially offset by increasesin accounts receivable. The increase in receivables during the first half of is largely due to the seasonal selling period of the Company\'s OutdoorLeisure division which experienced a stronger second quarter in than in. The Company participates in an accounts receivable securitization programto finance a portion of its accounts receivable. See Note to the CondensedConsolidated Financial Statements. In the first half of , cash used in investing activities was drivenby capital expenditures of . million, primarily for information systems,including expenditures for Year readiness and equipment and tooling for newproducts. Capital spending in the comparable period was . million andwas primarily for several manufacturing efficiency initiatives, equipment andtooling for new products and management information systems and softwarelicenses. The new product capital spending in the period principallyrelated to the appliance category and included costs related to water and airfiltration products which were discontinued in the second quarter, blenders,standmixers and irons. Cash used in investing activities in the first half of also reflects . million for the acquisitions of the shares of Colemanfrom a subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes, as well as the acquisitions ofSignature Brands and First Alert. The Company anticipates capital spendingto be less than of net sales. Capital expenditures in the current year areexpected to primarily relate to information systems and related support,including expenditures for Year readiness, new product introductions andcapacity additions. Cash provided by financing activities totaled . million in thefirst half of and reflected net borrowings under the Company\'s bank creditfacility. Cash provided by financing activities in the first half of was. million and reflected net proceeds from the debentures of . million,the cancellation and repayment of all outstanding balances under the Company\'s million September revolving credit facility, the repayment of certaindebt assumed in connection with the Coleman, Signature Brands and First Alertacquisitions, and the early extinguishment of the . million Hattiesburgbond. In addition, cash provided by financing activities in is net of .million of financing fees related to Sunbeam\'s . billion bank credit facilityand . million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. See Note tothe Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. At June , , standby and commercial letters of credit aggregated. million and were predominately for insurance, pension, environmental,workers\' compensation, and international trade activities. In addition, as ofJune , , surety bonds with a contract value of . million wereoutstanding largely for the Company\'s pension plans and as a result oflitigation judgments that are currently under appeal. For additional informationrelating to the debentures, the bank credit facility and the repayment of debt,see Note to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company expects to acquire the remaining equity interest in Colemanin a merger transaction in which the existing Coleman minority shareholders willreceive . of a share of the Company \'s common stock and . in cash foreach share of Coleman common stock outstanding. In addition, unexercised optionsunder Coleman\'s stock option plans will be cashed out at a price per share equalto the difference between . and the exercise price of such options. TheCompany expects to issue approximately . million shares of common stock andexpend approximately million in cash, including cash paid to option holders,to complete the Coleman transaction. Under a proposed settlement of certainlitigation relating to the Coleman merger, the Company will also issue warrantsto purchase up to . million shares of the Company\'s common stock to theColeman public stockholders and the plaintiff\'s litigation counsel uponconsummation of the Coleman merger. See Notes and to the CondensedConsolidated Financial Statements. Although there can be no assurance, it isanticipated that the Coleman merger will occur in the second half of fiscal. The Company believes its borrowing capacity under the bank creditfacility, cash flow from the combined operations of the Company and its acquiredcompanies, existing cash and cash equivalent balances, and its receivablesecuritization program will be sufficient to support working capital needs,capital expenditure and Year compliance spending, and debt service throughApril , . The Company intends to negotiate with its lenders on anamendment to the bank credit facility, negotiate with its lenders on further <PAGE>waiver of such covenants and other terms or refinance the bank credit facility.Any decisions with respect to such amendment, waiver, or refinancing will bemade based on a review from time to time of the advisability of particulartransactions. There can be no assurance that an amendment, further waiver ofexisting covenants and other terms, or refinancing will be entered into by April, . The failure to obtain such an amendment, further waiver or debtrefinancing would likely result in violation of existing covenants andcompliance with other terms, which would permit the bank lenders to acceleratethe maturity of all outstanding borrowings under the bank credit facility, whichwould likely have a material adverse effect on the Company. By letter dated June , , the staff of the Division of Enforcementof the SEC advised the Company that it was conducting an informal inquiry intothe Company \'s accounting policies and procedures and requested that the Companyproduce documents. On July , , the SEC issued a Formal Order of PrivateInvestigation, designating officers to take testimony and pursuant to which asubpoena was served on Sunbeam requiring the production of documents. OnNovember , , the Company received another SEC subpoena requiring theproduction of additional documents. The Company has provided numerous documentsto the SEC staff and continues to cooperate fully with the SEC staff. TheCompany cannot predict the term of such investigation or its potential outcome. The Company is involved in significant litigation, including class andderivative actions, relating to events which led to the restatement of itsconsolidated financial statements, the issuance of the MacAndrews & Forbeswarrant, the sale of the debentures and the employment agreements of Messrs.Dunlap and Kersh. Sunbeam intends to vigorously defend each of the actions, butcannot predict the outcome and is not currently able to evaluate the likelihoodof the Company \'s success in each case or the range of potential loss. However,if the Company were to lose these suits, judgments would likely have a materialadverse effect on the Company \'s financial position, results of operations andcash flows. Additionally, the Company\'s insurance carriers have filed varioussuits requesting a declaratory judgment that the directors\' and officers\'liability insurance policies for excess coverage was invalid andor had beenproperly canceled by the carriers or have advised Sunbeam of their intent todeny coverage under such policies. The Company intends to pursue recovery fromall of its insurers if damages are awarded against the Company or itsindemnified officers andor directors under any of the foregoing actions and torecover attorneys\' fees covered under those policies. The Company \'s failure toobtain such insurance recoveries following an adverse judgment against theCompany on any of the foregoing actions could have a material adverse effect onthe Company \'s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. As a consumer goods manufacturer and distributor, the Company faces theconstant risks of product liability and related lawsuits involving claims forsubstantial money damages, product recall actions and higher than anticipatedrates of warranty returns or other returns of goods. These claims could resultin liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\'sfinancial position and results of operations. Some of the product lines theCompany acquired in the acquisitions have increased its exposure to productliability and related claims. The Company and its subsidiaries are also involved in various lawsuitsfrom time to time that Sunbeam considers to be ordinary routine litigationincidental to its business. In the opinion of the Company, the resolution ofthese routine matters, and of matters relating to prior operations, individuallyor in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the financialposition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. See Note to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Effective January , , the Company adopted Statement of Position-, ACCOUNTING FOR THE COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPED OR OBTAINED FORINTERNAL USE (""SOP -""). SOP - requires computer software costs associatedwith internal use software to be expensed as incurred until certaincapitalization criteria are met. Adoption of this statement did not have amaterial impact on the Company\'s consolidated financial position, results ofoperations, or cash flows. In June , the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statementof Financial Accounting Standards No. (""SFAS No. ""), ACCOUNTING FORDERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, which, as amended, is effectivefor fiscal years beginning after June , . SFAS No. requires therecognition of all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as eitherassets or liabilities measured at fair value. The Company has not yet determinedthe impact SFAS No. will have on its consolidated financial position,results of operations, or cash flows. <PAGE>YEAR READINESS DISCLOSURE The Company is preparing for the impact of the Year on itsoperations. Year issues could include potential problems in the informationtechnology (""IT"") and non-IT systems that the Company uses in its operations andproblems in the Company\'s products. Year system failures could affectroutine but critical operations such as forecasting, purchasing, production,order processing, inventory control, shipping, billing and collection. Inaddition, system failures could affect the Company\'s security, payrolloperations, or employee safety. The Company may also be exposed to potentialrisks from third parties with whom the Company interacts who fail to adequatelyaddress their own Year issues.SUNBEAM\'S APPROACH TO YEAR ISSUES While the Company\'s Year readiness planning has been underway forover one year, during the third quarter of the Company established across-functional project team consisting of senior managers, assisted by threeexternal consulting firms which were retained to provide consulting services andto assist the Company in implementing its Year strategy. This team issponsored by the Company\'s Chief Financial Officer who reports directly to theCompany\'s Chief Executive Officer on this issue. The Audit Committee of theBoard of Directors is advised periodically on the status of the Company\'s Year readiness program. The Year project team has developed a phased approach to identifyand resolve Year issues with many of these activities conducted inparallel. The Company\'s approach and the anticipated timing of each phase aredescribed below. PHASE - INVENTORY AND ASSESSMENT: During the first phase of Sunbeam\'sYear readiness program, the Company established a Year ProgramManagement Office (""PMO"") to centralize the management of all of the Company\'sYear projects. Through this office, the Company developed a corporate-wide,uniform strategy for assessing and addressing the Year issues. The Company has completed an inventory of its hardware and softwaresystems, manufacturing equipment, electronic data interchange,telecommunications and other technical assets potentially subject to Year problems, such as security systems and controls for lighting, air conditioning,ventilation and facility access. This inventory was then entered into theCompany\'s Year database along with a determination of the item\'s level ofcriticality to operations. For those inventory items anticipated to have asignificant effect on the business if not corrected, the Company\'s Year program envisions repair or replacement and testing of such items. Allinformation relative to each item is being tracked in the Company\'s Year database. The Company completed most of this phase during the third and fourthquarters of . The Company has completed a review of the readiness ofembedded microprocessors in its products and determined that none of theCompany\'s products have Year date sensitive systems. PHASE - CORRECTION AND TESTING: The second phase of Sunbeam\'s Year readiness program is structured to replace, upgrade or remediate (asnecessary) those items identified during Phase as requiring corrective action. Sunbeam relies on its IT functions to perform many tasks that arecritical to its operations. Significant transactions that could be impacted bynot being ready for any Year issues include, among others, purchases ofmaterials, production management, order entry and fulfillment, and payrollprocessing. Systems and applications that have been identified by Sunbeam todate as not currently Year ready and which are critical to Sunbeam\'soperations include its financial software systems, which process the orderentry, purchasing, production management, general ledger, accounts receivable,and accounts payable functions, payroll applications, and critical applicationsin the Company\'s manufacturing and distribution facilities, such as warehousemanagement applications. Recognizing how dependent the entire company is on IT,Sunbeam decided in to replace its primary business applications with auniform international business and accounting information system to address thesystems or applications listed above as well as to improve internal reportingprocesses. Based upon representations from the manufacturer that the currentversion of this uniform information system is Year ready, the Company hasbeen actively upgrading its business sites that currently utilize this uniformsystem to the Year ready version. In addition to the pre-acquisitionSunbeam locations which had already utilized an earlier non-Year readyversion of this uniform business and accounting information system, Eastpak, Mr.Coffee, Health-o-Meter and Sunbeam Latin America are replacing their currentnon-Year ready systems with this new uniform system. In addition, ColemanEurope is also replacing key business components with this new system. The Company is also actively replacing andor upgrading a number ofbusiness systems that are not Year <PAGE>ready, including those that use localized business system packages which werenot candidates to be replaced by the uniform business and accounting informationsystem. For example, at Coleman approximately , mainframe software programsthat are used in lieu of Sunbeam\'s uniform business and accounting informationsystem have been remediated and tested to be Year ready. With respect tothe Company\'s non-IT systems (for example, time and attendance, security, andin-line manufacturing hardware) the Company is actively analyzing these items toassess any Year issues. To date, no material issues have been discovered,and the Company will continue to review, test and correct, if necessary, suchitems. Sunbeam has largely implemented the corrective work described above andexpects to complete final testing and implementation of such systems in thethird quarter and early fourth quarter of . PHASE - CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS: The third phaseof Sunbeam\'s Year readiness program which was initiated during the thirdand fourth quarters of is designed to assess and interact with theCompany\'s customers, suppliers, and business partners. As part of this effort,the Company surveyed , vendors and suppliers, a portion of which did notprovide an initial response. During the first half of , ""high risk"" vendorswere contacted directly and the number of non-respondents has since decreasedsubstantially. In fact, currently only of the Company\'s vendors who weresurveyed are categorized as ""high risk"" which includes non-respondents. Based onthe most recent responses to the survey and continued evaluation, the Companybelieves that there is only a low to a medium risk of Year issues for theremaining vendors. The Company will continue to monitor the Year progressof the ""high risk"" vendors and will re-survey these companies in late August todetermine the appropriate course of action. Furthermore, the Company is in theprocess of contacting alternate vendors who are Year ready to replacecritical vendors deemed ""high risk"" in the event that these vendors are notfound to be Year ready. The Company has not independently verified theresponses of vendors and does not anticipate undertaking such independentverification process. Beginning in the second quarter of , Sunbeam contacted its majorcustomers to confirm their preparations for Year issues. The Company hasalready responded to numerous customer inquiries about the Company\'s Year readiness and believes that all of the Company\'s major customers haveestablished programs to deal with Year issues. In order to improve theCompany\'s communication with its customers, suppliers and business partners, theCompany has set up a Sunbeam Year telephone number and is providing Year information on a Company web site. PHASE - CONTINGENCY PLANNING: This phase involves contingencyplanning for unresolved Year issues, particularly any issues arising withthird party suppliers. The Company\'s Year readiness program is ongoing andits ultimate scope, as well as the consideration of contingency plans, willcontinue to be evaluated as new information becomes available. As aprecautionary measure, Sunbeam plans to establish a contingency plan foraddressing any effects of the Year on its operations, whether due toSunbeam\'s systems or those of third parties not being ready for any Year issues. Sunbeam expects to complete such contingency plan by September , ;such contingency plan will address alternative processes, such as manualprocedures, electronic spreadsheets, potential alternative service providers,and plans to address Year readiness issues as they arise. Such contingencyplans may also require an increase in inventory during the second half of to protect against supply interruption.THE RISKS OF SUNBEAM\'S YEAR APPROACH The independent consultants assisting the Company in its Year readiness program have reviewed and concurred with the Company\'s approach, haveassisted in developing cost estimates and have monitored costs for the largestsingle component (upgrade or installation of the Company\'s uniform system) ofthe Company\'s Year program. Since Sunbeam\'s Year program was developedand is monitored with the help of independent consultants, the Company did notengage another independent third party to verify the program\'s overall approachor total cost as the Company believes that the Company\'s exposure in this regardis mitigated. In addition, through the use of external third-party diagnosticsoftware packages that are designed to analyze the Year readiness ofbusiness software programs, the Company was able to identify potential Year issues at Coleman. Given this, the Company believes that it has also mitigatedits risk by validating and verifying key program components. Management believes that, although there are significant systems thatare being modified or replaced, including the uniform business and accountinginformation system, Sunbeam\'s information systems environment will be made Year ready prior to January , . Sunbeam\'s failure to timely complete suchcorrective work could have a material adverse impact on the Company. <PAGE> With respect to customers, suppliers and business partners, the failureof certain of these third parties to become Year ready could also have amaterial adverse impact on Sunbeam. For example, the failure of certain of theCompany\'s principal suppliers to have Year ready internal systems couldimpact the Company\'s ability to manufacture andor ship its products or tomaintain adequate inventory levels for production. At this time, the Company believes that the most likely ""worst-case""scenario relating to Year involves potential disruptions in areas in whichthe Company\'s operations must rely on third parties, such as suppliers, whosesystems may not work properly after January , . While such system failurescould either directly or indirectly affect important operations of the Companyand its subsidiaries in a significant manner, the Company cannot at presentestimate either the likelihood or the potential cost of such failures. Subjectto the nature of the goods or services provided to the Company by third partieswhose operations are not made ready for Year issues, the impact onSunbeam\'s operations could be material if appropriate contingency plans cannotbe developed prior to January , . The nature and focus of the Company\'s efforts to address the Year problem may be revised periodically as interim goals are achieved or new issuesare identified. In addition, it is important to note that the description of theCompany\'s efforts and assessments necessarily involves estimates and projectionswith respect to activities required in the future. These estimates andprojections are subject to change as work continues, and such changes may besubstantial.THE COSTS TO ADDRESS THE COMPANY\'S YEAR ISSUES Through the first half of , including costs incurred in ,Sunbeam had expended approximately million to address Year issues ofwhich approximately was recorded as capital expenditures and the remainderas SG&A expense. Sunbeam\'s current assessment of the total costs to address andremedy Year issues and enhance its operating systems, including costs forthe acquired companies, is approximately million. This estimate includes thefollowing categories: o uniform international business and accounting systems million o localized business system software upgrades and remediation million o Year readiness assessment and tracking million o upgrade of personal computers and related software million The amount to be incurred for Year issues during ofapproximately million represents over of the Company\'s total budgetfor information systems and related support, including Year costs. A largemajority of these costs are expected to be incremental expenditures that willnot recur in the Year or thereafter. Fees and expenses related to thirdparty consultants, who are involved in the PMO as well as the modification andreplacement of software, represent approximately of the total estimatedcost. The balance of the total estimated cost relates primarily to softwarelicense fees and new hardware, but excludes the costs associated with Companyemployees. Sunbeam expects these expenditures to be financed through operatingcash flows or borrowings, as applicable. A significant portion of theseexpenditures will enhance Sunbeam\'s operating systems in addition to resolvingthe Year issues. As Sunbeam completes its assessment of the Year issues, the actual expenditures incurred or to be incurred may differ materiallyfrom the amounts shown above. Because Year readiness is critical to the business, Sunbeam hasredeployed some resources from non-critical system enhancements to address Year issues, thereby deferring the non-critical systems enhancements. TheCompany does not expect these redeployments and deferrals to have a materialimpact on the Company\'s financial condition, results of operations, or cashflows.CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form -Q may constitute""forward-looking"" statements within the meaning of the Private SecuritiesLitigation Reform Act of , as the same may be amended from time to time(herein the ""Act"") and in releases made by the SEC from time to time.

In addition, the Company assumed approximately ,million in debt. Immediately thereafter, as a result of the exercise of Colemanemployee stock options, Sunbeam\'s indirect beneficial ownership of Colemandecreased to approximately of the total number of the outstanding shares ofColeman common stock. The Company\'s agreement for the acquisition of theremaining publicly held Coleman shares pursuant to a merger transaction providesthat the remaining Coleman shareholders will receive: o approximately . million shares of Sunbeam common stock (. of a share for each outstanding Coleman share); and, o approximately million in cash (. for each outstanding Coleman share and the cash-out of unexercised Coleman employee stock options for an amount equal to the difference between . per share and the exercise price of such options).

See Note to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statementsfor information regarding the settlement claims relating to the Colemanacquisition, the terms of which provide for the issuance at the time of themerger of warrants to purchase up to . million shares of Sunbeam\'s commonstock at per share. On April , , the Company completed the cash acquisitions of FirstAlert, a leading manufacturer of smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, andSignature Brands, a leading manufacturer of consumer and professional products.The First Alert and the Signature Brands acquisitions were valued atapproximately million (including million of cash and million ofassumed debt) and approximately million (reflecting cash paid, includingthe required retirement or defeasance of debt), respectively.

Certain amounts included in the historical results of theacquired companies have been reclassified to conform with the Company\'spresentation. Presentation of these combined results is to enhance comparabilitybetween the periods presented and not necessarily indicative of the combinedresults that would have occurred had these acquisitions been consummated at thebeginning of .PROVISION FOR INVENTORY In the second quarter of , the Company recorded a charge of .million as a result of the following: o Inventories were built during and the first half of in anticipation of sales volumes which did not materialize. As a result, it has been and will continue to be necessary to dispose of some portions of excess inventories at amounts less than cost. Accordingly, in the second quarter of , when the facts and circumstances were known that such sales volume would not materialize, the Company recorded . million in charges to properly state this inventory at the lower-of-cost-or-market. This inventory primarily related to certain appliances, grills and grill accessories. o A charge of . million was recorded during the second quarter of for excess inventories for raw material and work in process that will not be used due to outsourcing the production of breadmakers, toasters, and certain other appliances. o In the second quarter of , the Company made the decision to exit certain product lines, primarily air and water filtration products and eliminate certain stock keeping units (""SKU\'s"") within existing product lines, primarily relating to appliances, grills and grill accessories. As a result of this decision, a . million charge was recorded during the second quarter of to properly state this inventory at the lower-of-cost-or market. These charges to record excess inventories at thelower-of-cost-or-market were based upon management\'s best estimate of netrealizable value. (See Note to the Condensed Consolidated FinancialStatements.) <PAGE> In addition to the charge taken in , the excess and obsoleteinventory referenced above has impacted the Company\'s operating results inseveral ways, with two primary effects. First, gross margins have been impactedby sales, at below normal prices, of obsolete inventory into non-traditionalchannels and excess inventory into traditional channels. In addition, due to thehigh levels of excess inventory at the end of , the Company\'s usage of itsmanufacturing facilities has been lower than normal, resulting in lower grossmargins in .ASSET IMPAIRMENT Management made decisions to outsource or discontinue a substantialnumber of products previously made by the Company (principally breadmakers,toasters and certain other appliances, air and water filtration products and theelimination of certain SKU\'s within existing product lines, primarily relatingto appliances, grills and grill accessories). As a result, certain facilitiesand equipment would either no longer be used or would be utilized in asignificantly different manner. Accordingly, a charge of . million wasrecorded in Cost of Goods Sold to write certain of these assets down to theirestimated fair market value. (See Note to the Condensed Consolidated FinancialStatements.)PURCHASE ACCOUNTING The Company recorded the acquisitions using the purchase method ofaccounting. In accordance with this accounting method, inventory pertaining tothe acquisitions was recorded at fair value. The fair value of the inventoryexceeded the book value reflected on the balance sheets of the acquiredcompanies as of the respective acquisition dates. The excess of the fair valueof inventory over its pre-acquisition book value was recorded in cost of salesas the inventory was sold. The adjustment above removes this non-recurringimpact (. million).FORMER EMPLOYEES\' DEFERRED COMPENSATION On February , , the Company entered into new three-yearemployment agreements with its then Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and twoother senior officers of the Company. The new employment agreements providedfor, among other items, the acceleration of vesting of restricted stock and theforfeiture of unvested restricted stock that had been granted under theexecutives\' prior employment agreements, new restricted stock grants and optionsto purchase common shares. Total compensation expense recognized in the firstquarter of related to these items was approximately million. (See Note to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.) THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE , COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE , Consolidated net sales for the three months ended June , and were . million and . million respectively, an increase of .million or approximately . This increase was driven primarily by the OutdoorLeisure group where net sales increased . million to . million in thesecond quarter of . This increase was predominately driven by strong retailreplenishment demand of outdoor recreation products and Powermateregisteredtrademark generators (aggregating approximately million). The increase inoutdoor recreation products and Powermateregistered trademark generators isbelieved to be partially attributable to heightened consumer sensitivity to theneed for emergency preparedness. This increased sensitivity is believed to bereflective of a combination of factors including weather conditions and Year considerations. Outdoor cooking product net sales increased approximately million in the period as compared to the second quarter of , largelyas a result of reduced shipments in the year ago quarter to allow tradeinventories to return to appropriate levels. This factor affects the year toyear comparisons for each of the operating groups. These improvements werepartially offset by weaknesses in net sales of Eastpakregistered trademarkproducts. Household net sales increased . million to . million in .Despite the lack of significant new product introductions, overall net sales ofappliances, personal care, and health products increased approximately million as a result of a strengthening retail environment in the current yearand the effect of reduced shipments in the year ago quarter. During salesof coffee makers and smoke and carbon monoxide detectors were adversely effectedby the disruption that arose from the integration with Sunbeam and the relatedmanagement changes. Results for the second quarter of reflect improvementin the sales of coffee makers and smoke and carbon monoxide detectors(approximately million) from the prior year quarter, accounting for theremaining increase. International net sales increased . million to .million. The increase in net sales was largely driven by improved net sales inCanada of approximately million, resulting predominantly from strong retaildemand for Powermateregistered trademark and outdoor recreation products andthe effect of reduced shipments in the year ago quarter, as discussed above. Inaddition, net sales increased in Europe and Japan by approximately million inthe second quarter of as compared to the same period in , partiallyoffset by declining net sales of the Company\'s products in Latin America. TheCompany believes that weak economic conditions contributed to the decline inLatin American net sales. <PAGE> Gross margin for the second quarter in was . million or. million higher than the comparable period in . Excluding the effectsof non-recurring adjustments, as summarized above under "" Charges"",gross margin for was . million in the second quarter of . As apercentage of net sales, gross margin improved to approximately in thesecond quarter of as compared to the second quarter gross margin ofnegative and adjusted gross margin of approximately . The threeoperating groups contributed nearly equally to the margin improvements in the period. Approximately half of the Outdoor Leisure group\'s marginimprovement resulted from additional volume and an improved product mix with theremaining improvement resulting from favorable overhead absorption as a resultof higher manufacturing volumes. The improvement in the Household group wasdriven by appliances and personal care products which benefited from improvedmanufacturing efficiencies and cost benefits achieved from sourcing additionalfinished goods from third party vendors. Approximately of the improvement inthe International group\'s gross margin resulted from the benefit of the shutdown of the Mexico City manufacturing facility which had experienced highmaterial usage costs and employee benefit costs in the second quarter a yearago. The remaining improvement in the International group resulted from grossmargin generated by higher sales volumes and a lower level of product returns. SG&A expense in the second quarter of was . million,representing an . increase over the same period in the prior year. Excludingthe effect of Year compliance efforts (. million) recorded in the secondquarter of , SG&A expense increased approximately million (approximately) in as compared to the same period in . This increase is largelyattributable to higher levels of selling and administrative costs primarily inthe Outdoor Leisure and International segments driven by increased net sales. Inaddition, SG&A expense in the second quarter of reflects costs associatedwith certain redundant operations resulting from the Company\'s acquisitionsand the decision to bring in-house certain operating activities that arecurrently outsourced. The Company is in the process of fully integrating certainof these functions and expects that when this process has been completedconsolidated SG&A expense for these functions will be reduced. Consolidated operating results for the second quarters of and, were a profit of . million in and a loss of . million in. Operating results for the second quarter of , as adjusted, were a lossof . million. This change resulted from the factors discussed above. Interest expense in the second quarter of was . million ascompared to . million in the same period in the prior year. Approximatelyhalf of this increase is attributable to higher levels of borrowings during thesecond quarter of . The increased level of borrowings was attributable tocapital expenditures since the second quarter of . The balance of theincrease was driven by the impact of higher interest rates during the period and the amortization of the loan commitment fee (approximately million) the Company is obligated to pay under the terms of the New CreditFacility. See Note to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for adiscussion of the loan commitment fee. Other expense, net of . million for the second quarter of included approximately million relating to the bank credit facility and thedebentures. The increased credit facility expenses primarily related to unusedfacility fees and the debenture expense related to liquidated damages payable todebenture holders. (See Note to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.)Other expense, net of . million for the second quarter of primarilyrepresents foreign exchange losses principally at the Company\'s operations inMexico, Venezuela and Canada. Other expense for this period also includesapproximately . million related to unused facility fees. Expenses during thesecond quarter of and were partially offset by interest income of .million and . million, respectively. The minority interest reported for the second quarter of and relates to the minority interest held in Coleman by minority shareholders. Approximately million of the . million income tax expenserecorded in the second quarter of related to a U.S. tax liability generatedby Coleman as a separate U.S. tax filing entity. As discussed below, in July, the Company acquired a sufficient ownership interest in Coleman to permitit and Coleman to file consolidated U.S. tax returns with Coleman for all futureperiods. The remaining tax expense recorded in the second quarter of related to taxes on foreign income. Tax expense recorded for the second quarterof was nearly all related to foreign taxes. No net tax benefit was recordedon the Company\'s losses in either year as it is management\'s assessment that theCompany cannot demonstrate that it is more likely than not that deferred taxassets resulting from these losses would be realized through future taxableincome. On July , , the Company acquired ,, shares of a newlycreated series of Coleman voting preferred stock for an aggregate purchase priceof approximately million. These shares, together with the shares of Colemancommon stock the Company owns, enable Sunbeam to exercise . of the totalvoting power of Coleman\'s outstanding capital stock as of July , . Thisclass of preferred stock was created by Coleman and acquired by the Company inorder to <PAGE>enable Coleman and the Company to file consolidated federal income taxreturns, and in certain jurisdictions, consolidated state income tax returns,prior to the consummation of the Coleman merger. In connection with the issuanceof the shares of preferred stock, the Company entered into a tax sharingagreement with Coleman, pursuant to which Coleman will pay to Sunbeam amountsequal to the federal and state income taxes that would have been payable byColeman had Coleman not been included in the consolidated income tax return ofthe Company. The net proceeds from the issuance of the shares by Coleman of itsvoting preferred stock to Coleman Worldwide were used by Coleman to make apartial repayment of loans outstanding from Sunbeam under the Intercompany Note.(See Note to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.) As a result of repayment of certain indebtedness assumed in the Colemanacquisition, the Company recognized an extraordinary charge in the secondquarter of . The debt assumed in connection with the Coleman acquisition wasrepaid as a result of the requirements under the terms of the New CreditFacility. This extraordinary charge consisted of redemption premiums (.million), unamortized debt discount (. million) and unamortized deferredfinancing costs (. million) and was net of income taxes (. million). (SeeNote to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.)SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE , COMPARED TO SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE , Net sales for the six months ended June , and were ,.million and . million respectively, an increase of . million. Resultsfor the six months ended June , include Coleman, Signature Brands andFirst Alert from their respective acquisition dates. After adjusting salesto include sales of the acquired companies for the periods from the beginning of through the respective dates of acquisition, combined historical net saleswould be ,. million. net sales increased approximately million orapproximately over combined historical net sales. Information thatadjusts for the results of the acquisitions prior to the actual acquisitiondates (the ""combined historical"" information) is provided for informationalpurposes only and is to enhance comparability of the period presented. Thisinformation is not necessarily indicative of what the combined results wouldhave been had these acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the periodspresented. The increase in net sales is driven by the Outdoor Leisure groupwhich had an increase of approximately million in as compared to thecombined historical net sales in the same period in the prior year. Thisincrease over combined historical net sales was largely due to sales of outdoorrecreation products and Powermateregistered trademark generators. The higherlevel of sales of these products is believed to be partially attributable toheightened consumer sensitivity to the need for emergency preparedness. TheCompany believes that this heightened sensitivity is reflective of a combinationof factors, including weather conditions and Year considerations. Householdnet sales in decreased approximately million compared to combinedhistorical net sales. The Company believes that the channel loading that tookplace in the first quarter of was primarily responsible for this decrease.International net sales in increased . million over combinedhistorical net sales. Higher sales in Canada and Europe resulted predominantlyfrom strong retail demand of Powermateregistered trademark and outdoorrecreation products. This increase was partially offset by the impact of weakeconomic conditions in Latin America. Gross margin for the first half of was . million or .million higher than the comparable period in . Adjusting for the combinedresults of the acquired companies and excluding the effects of non-recurring adjustments, which are summarized above under the heading ""Charges"", gross margin for the first half of increased approximately million over the combined historical gross margin, with each of theoperating groups contributing to the margin improvement. As a percentage of netsales, gross margin improved to approximately in the first half of ascompared to a negative in the first half of . The gross margin percentagefor the period adjusted for the non-recurring charges and for the effect ofthe acquired companies was approximately of combined historical net sales.The Household group contributed approximately million of the grossmargin improvement over the combined historical gross margin. Theimprovement in the Household group\'s gross margin resulted primarily fromimproved manufacturing processes and controls and reduced sales returns andallowances. The Outdoor Leisure group\'s gross margin in improved byapproximately million over combined historical gross margin.Approximately of the improvement in the Outdoor Leisure group\'s gross marginresulted from additional volume and improved mix. The remaining improvementresulted from improved manufacturing overhead absorption. The Internationalgroup contributed approximately million of the gross margin improvementover combined historical gross margin. Approximately of the improvementin the International group\'s gross margin resulted from the shut down of theMexico City manufacturing facility which had experienced high material usagecosts and employee benefit costs in the prior year. The remaining improvementresulted from a lower level of product returns. SG&A expense for the first six months of was . million, anincrease of . million or . over the same period in the prior year. Afteradjusting SG&A expense to include the acquired companies\' SG&A expense <PAGE>for the period from the beginning of through the respective dates ofacquisition (. million), combined historical SG&A expense was .million. Since the combined historical SG&A expenses were derived by addingthe acquired companies\' pre-acquisition period costs to the reported six months\'results of Sunbeam, the combined historical SG&A expenses include . millionof amortization of intangibles expense representing both pre- andpost-acquisition periods, as well as approximately million of transactioncosts incurred by the acquired companies relating the them being purchased bySunbeam. Excluding these costs, and the non-recurring charges of .million, as described above under "" Charges"", adjusted SG&A expenseswere approximately million. The SG&A expenses included . millionof amortization of intangibles expense and . million of costs for Year compliance efforts. Excluding these costs, the adjusted SG&A costs were. million, nearly flat with a year ago. Operating results for the first halves of and , were a loss of. million in and a loss of . million in . Adjusted for thehistorical results of the acquired companies and excluding non-recurringcharges, as previously described, operating results for the and periods were losses of . million and . million, respectively. This changeresulted from the factors discussed above. Interest expense increased from . million in the first half of to . million in the first half of . Nearly all of the change related tohigher borrowing levels in resulting primarily from borrowings for theacquisitions that were outstanding for the entire six month period ascompared to only a portion of the period. Other expense, net of . million for the first half of includedapproximately million relating to the bank credit facility and thedebentures. The credit facility expenses primarily related to unused facilityfees and the debenture expense related to liquidated damages payable todebenture holders. (See Note to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.)Other expense, net of . million for the first half of primarilyrepresented foreign exchange losses principally at the Company\'s operations inMexico, Venezuela and Canada. Other expense for this period also includesapproximately . million relating to an unused facility fee. Expenses duringboth periods were partially offset by interest income of . million. The minority interest reported in and relates to the minorityinterest held in Coleman by minority shareholders. Approximately million of the . million income tax expenserecorded in related to a U.S. tax liability generated by Coleman as aseparate U.S. tax filing entity. As previously discussed, in July , theCompany acquired a sufficient ownership interest in Coleman to permit it to fileconsolidated U.S. tax returns with Coleman for all future periods. The remainingtax expense recorded in related to taxes on foreign income. Tax expenserecorded in was nearly all related to foreign taxes. No net tax benefit wasrecorded on the Company\'s losses in either year as it is management\'s assessmentthat the Company cannot demonstrate that it is more likely than not thatdeferred tax assets resulting from these losses would be realized through futuretaxable income. In March , the Company prepaid a . million . industrialrevenue bond related to its Hattiesburg facility originally due in . Inconnection with the early extinguishment of this debt, the Company recognized anextraordinary charge in the first quarter of . As a result of repayment ofcertain indebtedness assumed in the Coleman acquisition, the Company alsorecognized and extraordinary charge in the second quarter of . The debtassumed in connection with the Coleman acquisition was repaid as a result of therequirements under the terms of the New Credit Facility. These extraordinarycharges consisted of redemption premiums (. million), unamortized debtdiscount (. million) and unamortized deferred financing costs (. million)and were net of income taxes (. million).FOREIGN OPERATIONS Approximately of the Company\'s business is conducted in U.S. dollars (including both domestic sales, U.S. dollar denominated export sales, primarily to certain Latin American markets, Asian sales and the majority of European sales). The Company\'s non-U.S. dollar denominated sales are made principally by subsidiaries in Europe, Canada, Japan, Latin America and Mexico. Mexico reverted to a hyperinflationary status for accounting purposes in ; therefore, translation adjustments related to Mexican net monetary assets were included as a component of net (loss) earnings. Mexico is not considered hyperinflationary as of January , . This change in Mexico\'s hyperinflationary status is not expected to have a material effect on the Company\'s financial results. Translation adjustments resulting from the Company\'s non-U.S. denominated subsidiaries have not had a material impact on the Company\'s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. <PAGE> While revenues generated in Asia have traditionally not beensignificant, economic instability in this region is expected to have a negativeeffect on earnings. Economic instability and the political environment in LatinAmerica have also affected sales in that region. It is anticipated that sales inand exports to these regions will continue to be impacted so long as theeconomic environments in those regions remain unsettled. On a limited basis, the Company selectively uses derivatives (foreignexchange option and forward contracts) to manage foreign exchange exposures thatarise in the normal course of business. No derivative contracts are entered intofor trading or speculative purposes. The use of derivatives has not had amaterial impact on the Company\'s financial results.SEASONALITY Sunbeam\'s consolidated sales are not expected to exhibit substantialseasonality; however, sales are expected to be strongest during the secondquarter of the calendar year. Furthermore, sales of a number of products,including warming blankets, vaporizers, humidifiers, grills, First Alertproducts, camping and generator products may be impacted by unseasonable weatherconditions.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESDEBT INSTRUMENTS In order to finance the acquisition of Coleman, First Alert andSignature Brands and to refinance substantially all of the indebtedness of theCompany and the three acquired companies, the Company consummated an offering inMarch of zero coupon debentures having a yield to maturity of (approximately , million principal amount at maturity), which resulted inapproximately million of net proceeds and borrowed about , millionunder its new bank credit facility. The debentures are exchangeable for shares of the Company\'s commonstock at an initial conversion rate of . shares for each , principalamount at maturity of the debentures, subject to adjustments upon occurrence ofspecified events. The debentures are subordinated in right of payment to allexisting and future senior indebtedness of the Company. The debentures are notredeemable by the Company prior to March , . On or after such date, thedebentures are redeemable for cash with at least days notice, at the optionof the Company. The Company is required to purchase debentures at the option ofthe holder as of March , , March , and March , , at purchaseprices equal to the issue price plus accrued original discount to such dates.Sunbeam may, at its option, elect to pay any such purchase price in cash orcommon stock or any combination thereof. However, the bank credit facilityprohibits the Company from redeeming or repurchasing debentures for cash. TheCompany was required to file a registration statement with the SEC to registerthe debentures by June , . This registration statement was filed onFebruary , and the SEC has not declared the registration statementeffective. The Company\'s failure to file the registration statement by June , did not constitute default under the terms of the debentures. As part ofthe normal review process by the SEC, a number of comments have been made by thestaff of the Division of Corporation Finance relating to the registrationstatement and the restated and financial statements included therein.The Company has filed amendments to this registration statement. From June , until the registration statement is declared effective, the Company isrequired to pay to the debenture holders cash liquidated damages accruing, foreach day during such period, at a rate per annum equal to . during the first days and . thereafter multiplied by the total of the issue price of thedebentures plus the original issue discount thereon on such day. The Companymade its first payment of approximately , to the debenture holders onSeptember , and an additional million was paid on March , . Anadditional cash payment of approximately million, representing the Company\'sliability to debenture holders through June , , was paid on September ,. Concurrent with the acquisitions, the Company replaced its millionsyndicated unsecured five-year revolving credit facility with the bank creditfacility. The bank credit facility provided for aggregate borrowings of up to. billion and in addition to other customary covenants, required the Companyto maintain specified consolidated leverage, interest coverage and fixed chargecoverage ratios as of the end of each fiscal quarter occurring after March , and on or prior to the latest stated maturity date for any of theborrowings under the bank credit facility. As a result of, among other things, its operating losses incurredduring the first half of , the Company did not achieve the specifiedfinancial ratios for June , and it appeared unlikely that the Companywould achieve the specified financial ratios for September , .Consequently, the Company and its lenders entered into an agreement <PAGE>dated as of June , that waived through December , all defaultsarising from the failure of the Company to satisfy the specified financialratios for June , and September , . Pursuant to an agreement withthe Company dated as of October , , the Company\'s lenders extended all ofthe waivers under the June agreement through April , and also waivedthrough such date all defaults arising from any failure by the Company tosatisfy the specified financial ratios for December , . As part of theOctober , agreement, the Company agreed to a minimum monthly earningsbefore interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (""EBITDA"") covenant (asdefined in the bank credit facility) which covenant the Company had been able tosatisfy. On April , , among other things, the lenders extended all of thewaivers set forth in the October , agreement through April , . OnApril , , the Company and its lenders entered into a comprehensiveamendment to the bank credit facility that, among other things, extended all ofthe waivers under the April , agreement until April , and waiveduntil such date all defaults arising from any failure by the Company to satisfythe specified financial ratios for any fiscal quarter end occurring during and for March , . Following is a description of the significant terms ofthe bank credit facility as amended April , . As part of the April , bank credit facility amendment, the Company agreed to a minimum cumulativeEBITDA covenant that is based on post-December , consolidated EBITDA andis tested at the end of each month occurring on or prior to March , , aswell as a covenant limiting the amount of revolving loans (other than those usedto fund the Coleman merger) that may be outstanding under the bank creditfacility as of the end of each such month. The minimum cumulative EBITDA wasinitially . million for the period January , through April , andgenerally grows on a monthly basis until it reaches . million for theperiod from January , through March , .The bank credit facility provides for aggregate borrowings of up to . billionthrough: o a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to . million maturing March , , . million of which may only be used to complete the Coleman; o up to . million in term loans maturing on March , , of which . million may only be used to complete the Coleman merger; and o a . million term loan maturing September , , of which . million has already been repaid through June , . As of June , , approximately . billion was outstanding andapproximately . billion was available for borrowing under the bank creditfacility. The remaining . billion of the . billion bank credit facilitywas committed for outstanding letters of credit.Under the bank credit facility, interest accrues, at the Company\'s option: o at the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR""); o or at the base rate of the administrative agent which is generally the higher of the prime commercial lending rate of the administrative agent or the Federal Funds Rate plus .;in each case plus an interest margin which is currently . for LIBOR loansand . for base rate loans. The interest margin is subject to potentialdecreases in the future, including a decrease to . for LIBOR loans and .for base rate loans upon consummation of the Coleman merger and theeffectiveness of the pledge of substantially all of Coleman\'s and its domesticsubsidiaries\' assets to secure the obligations under the bank credit facility. Under the terms of the April , amendment to the bank creditfacility, the Company is obligated to pay the bank lenders a loan commitment feeof between . to . of the commitments under the bank credit facility asof April , . The percentage used to calculate the fee will be determinedby reference to the bank lenders\' aggregate commmitments and loan exposure underthe bank credit facility as they may be reduced on or before September , .The fee is payable on the earlier of September , and the date thecommitments are terminated and the loans and other amount payable under the bankcredit facility are repaid. (See Note to the Condensed Consolidated FinancialStatements.) Borrowings under the bank credit facility are secured by a pledge ofthe stock of the Company\'s material subsidiaries, including Coleman, and by asecurity interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company and itsmaterial domestic subsidiaries, other than Coleman and its material subsidiariesexcept as described below. Currently, Coleman\'s inventory and related assets arepledged to secure its obligations for letters of credit issued for its account <PAGE>under the bank credit facility. Additionally, as security for Coleman\'s notepayable to the Company, Coleman pledged substantially all of its domesticassets, other than real property, including of the stock of its directforeign subsidiaries and domestic holding companies for its foreign subsidiariesand all of the stock of its other direct domestic subsidiaries but not theassets of Coleman\'s subsidiaries. The pledge runs in favor of the Company\'slending banks, to which the Coleman note has been pledged as security for theCompany\'s obligations to them. Upon completion of the Coleman merger,substantially all of Coleman\'s assets and the assets of Coleman\'s domesticsubsidiaries will be pledged to secure the obligations under the bank creditfacility. In addition, borrowings under the bank credit facility are guaranteedby a number of the Company\'s wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries andthese subsidiary guarantees are secured as described above. Upon completion ofthe Coleman merger, Coleman and each of its United States subsidiaries willbecome guarantors of the obligations under the bank credit facility. To theextent extensions of credit are made to any subsidiaries of the Company, theobligations of such subsidiaries are guaranteed by the Company. In addition to the above described financial ratios and tests, the bankcredit facility contains covenants customary for credit facilities of a similarnature, including limitations on the ability of the Company and itssubsidiaries, including Coleman, to, among other things: o declare dividends or repurchase stock; o prepay, redeem or repurchase debt, incur liens and engage in sale-leaseback transactions; o make loans and investments; o incur additional debt (including revolving loans under the bank credit facility); o amend or otherwise alter material agreements or enter into restrictive agreements; o make capital and Year compliance expenditures; o engage in mergers, acquisitions and asset sales; o engage in certain transactions with specified affiliates; o settle certain litigation; o alter its cash management system; and o alter the businesses they conduct.Sunbeam is also required to comply with specified financial covenants andratios.The bank credit facility provides for events of default customary fortransactions of this type, including nonpayment, misrepresentation, breach ofcovenant, cross-defaults, bankruptcy, material adverse change arising fromcompliance with ERISA, material adverse judgments, entering into guarantees andchange of ownership and control. It is also an event of default under the bankcredit facility if the Company\'s registration statement in connection with theColeman merger is not declared effective by the SEC on or before October , (effective as of October , , the bank lenders agreed to extend thisdate to November , ), or if the merger does not occur within businessdays of the effectiveness of the registration statement or if the cashconsideration--including any payments on account of the exercise of anyappraisal rights, but excluding related legal, accounting and other customaryfees and expenses--to consummate the Coleman merger exceeds . million.Although there can be no assurance, the Company anticipates that it will satisfythese conditions. Furthermore, the bank credit facility requires the Company toprepay term loans under the bank credit facility on each of September , and December , to the extent that cash on hand in the Company\'sconcentration accounts plus the aggregate amount of unused revolving loancommitments on these dates (excluding, for the September measurement date, .million reserved for the Coleman merger), exceeds million and million,respectively, but the Company is not required to prepay more than . millionin the aggregate as a result of the provision. Unless waived by the bank lenders, the failure of the Company tosatisfy any of the financial ratios and tests contained in the bank creditfacility or the occurrence of any other event of default under the bank creditfacility would entitle the bank lenders to (a) receive a . increase in theinterest rate applicable to outstanding loans and increase the trade letter ofcredit fees to . and (b) accelerate the maturity of the outstandingborrowings under the bank credit facility and exercise all or any of their otherrights and remedies. Any such acceleration or other exercise of rights andremedies would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company. The bank credit facility also includes provisions for the deferral ofthe scheduled term loan payments of . million until April , as aresult of the satisfaction by the Company on May , of the agreed uponconditions to the deferral. (See Note to the Condensed Consolidated FinancialStatements.) <PAGE>CASH FLOWS As of June , , the Company had cash and cash equivalents of .million and total debt of . billion. Because the waivers granted by theCompany\'s lenders expire on April , , the borrowings under the bank creditfacility, as well as other debt containing cross-default provisions, areclassified as short-term in the June , Condensed Consolidated BalanceSheet. Cash used in operating activities during the first half of was .million compared to . million in the first half of . This change isprimarily attributable to working capital improvements and improved operatingresults. The majority of the working capital improvements are attributable tothe Company\'s management of inventory levels. Inventories generatedapproximately million of additional cash flow versus the same period in theprior year. The inventory change in the period reflects inventory changesof the acquired companies from their respective dates of acquisition. Increasesin accounts payable generated approximately million of cash in the first sixmonths of whereas payables used approximately million of cash in thesame period of , resulting in an improvement in cash flow period-to-periodof approximately million. The increase in payables in the current periodresulted from payables balances having been reduced to a low level by year-end. This reduction in payables, which included an effort to reduce delinquentpayables, began in the second quarter of . These cash flow improvements arepartially offset by increases in accounts receivable. The increase inreceivables during the first half of is largely due to the seasonal sellingperiod of the Company\'s Outdoor Leisure division which experienced a strongersecond quarter in than in . The Company participates in an accountsreceivable securitization program to finance a portion of its accountsreceivable. See Note to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. In the first half of , cash used in investing activities was drivenby capital expenditures of . million, primarily for information systems,including expenditures for Year readiness and equipment and tooling for newproducts. Capital spending in the comparable period was . million andwas primarily for several manufacturing efficiency initiatives, equipment andtooling for new products and management information systems and softwarelicenses. The new product capital spending in the period principallyrelated to the appliance category and included costs related to water and airfiltration products which were discontinued in the second quarter, blenders,standmixers and irons. Cash used in investing activities in the first half of also reflects . million for the acquisitions of the shares of Colemanfrom a subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes, as well as the acquisitions ofSignature Brands and First Alert. The Company anticipates capital spendingto be less than of net sales. Capital expenditures in the current year areexpected to primarily relate to information systems and related support,including expenditures for Year readiness, new product introductions andcapacity additions. Cash provided by financing activities totaled . million in thefirst half of and reflected net borrowings under the Company\'s bank creditfacility. Cash provided by financing activities in the first half of was. million and reflected net proceeds from the debentures of . million,the cancellation and repayment of all outstanding balances under the Company\'s million September revolving credit facility, the repayment of certaindebt assumed in connection with the Coleman, Signature Brands and First Alertacquisitions, and the early extinguishment of the . million Hattiesburgbond. In addition, cash provided by financing activities in is net of .million of financing fees related to Sunbeam\'s . billion bank credit facilityand . million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. (See Note to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.) At June , , standby and commercial letters of credit aggregated. million and were predominately for insurance, pension, environmental,workers\' compensation, and international trade activities. In addition, as ofJune , , surety bonds with a contract value of . million wereoutstanding largely for the Company\'s pension plans and as a result oflitigation judgments that are currently under appeal. For additional informationrelating to the debentures, the bank credit facility and the repayment of debt,see Note to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company expects to acquire the remaining equity interest in Colemanin a merger transaction in which the existing Coleman minority shareholders willreceive . of a share of the Company\'s common stock and . in cash foreach share of Coleman common stock outstanding. In addition, unexercised optionsunder Coleman\'s stock option plans will be cashed out at a price per share equalto the difference between . and the exercise price of such options. TheCompany expects to issue approximately . million shares of common stock andexpend approximately million in cash, including cash paid to option holders,to complete the Coleman transaction. Under a proposed settlement of certainlitigation relating to the Coleman merger, the Company will also issue warrantsto purchase up to . million shares of the Company\'s common stock to theColeman public stockholders and the plaintiff\'s litigation counsel uponconsummation of the Coleman merger. (See Notes and to the CondensedConsolidated Financial Statements.) Although there can be no assurance, it isanticipated that the Coleman merger will occur in the second half of fiscal. <PAGE> The Company believes its borrowing capacity under the bank creditfacility, cash flow from the combined operations of the Company and its acquiredcompanies, existing cash and cash equivalent balances, and its receivablesecuritization program will be sufficient to support working capital needs,capital expenditure and Year compliance spending, and debt service throughApril , . The Company intends to negotiate with its lenders on anamendment to the bank credit facility, negotiate with its lenders on furtherwaiver of such covenants and other terms or refinance the bank credit facility.Any decisions with respect to such amendment, waiver, or refinancing will bemade based on a review from time to time of the advisability of particulartransactions. There can be no assurance that an amendment, further waiver ofexisting covenants and other terms, or refinancing will be entered into by April, . The failure to obtain such an amendment, further waiver or debtrefinancing would likely result in violation of existing covenants andcompliance with other terms, which would permit the bank lenders to acceleratethe maturity of all outstanding borrowings under the bank credit facility, whichwould likely have a material adverse effect on the Company. Accordingly, debtrelated to the bank credit facility and all debt containing cross-defaultprovisions is classified as current in the balance sheet at June , . In May, , the NYSE advised the Company that it did not meet thecontinuing listing standards of the NYSE because the Company did not havetangible net assets of at least million and average annual net income of atleast , for , and . Representatives from the Company metwith NYSE officials, and in March , the NYSE informed the Company that theCompany\'s common stock would not be delisted at that time, although the NYSEwould, however, continue to monitor Sunbeam\'s financial condition andoperations. On August , , the NYSE advised the Company that the NYSE hadrevised its continuing listing standards, and that the Company is in compliancewith the revised standards. In April, the NYSE advised Coleman that it did not meet the NYSE\'scontinuing listing standards because Coleman did not have tangible net assets ofat least million as of September , and average annual net income ofat least , for , and . At that time, Coleman requested theNYSE to continue to list the Coleman common stock until completion of themerger. The NYSE subsequently advised Coleman that Coleman also failed tosatisfy certain non-financial continuing listing standards. On August , ,the NYSE advised the Coleman that the NYSE had revised its continuing listingstandards, and that Coleman is in compliance with the revised financialstandards. Coleman and the NYSE have agreed upon a program whereby Coleman willcorrect the deficiencies in its non-financial continuing listing standards bythe end of . Coleman is currently complying with such program. If Colemanwere to be delisted from the NYSE, it would adversely affect Coleman\'s abilityto sell its capital stock to third parties or use its capital stock ascollateral for loans. Sunbeam\'s bank credit facility currently restricts Colemanfrom taking such actions. By letter dated June , , the staff of the Division of Enforcementof the SEC advised the Company that it was conducting an informal inquiry intothe Company\'s accounting policies and procedures and requested that the Companyproduce documents. On July , , the SEC issued a Formal Order of PrivateInvestigation, designating officers to take testimony and pursuant to which asubpoena was served on Sunbeam requiring the production of documents. OnNovember , , the Company received another SEC subpoena requiring theproduction of additional documents. The Company has provided numerous documentsto the SEC staff and continues to cooperate with the SEC staff. The Company has,however declined to provide the SEC with material that the Company believes issubject to the attorney-client privilege and the work product immunity. TheCompany cannot predict the term of such investigation or its potential outcome. The Company is involved in significant litigation, including class andderivative actions, relating to events which led to the restatement of itsconsolidated financial statements, the issuance of the MacAndrews & Forbeswarrant, the sale of the debentures and the employment agreements of Messrs.Dunlap and Kersh. Sunbeam intends to vigorously defend each of the actions, butcannot predict the outcome and is not currently able to evaluate the likelihoodof the Company\'s success in each case or the range of potential loss. However,if the Company were to lose these suits, judgments would likely have a materialadverse effect on the Company\'s financial position, results of operations andcash flows. Additionally, the Company\'s insurance carriers have filed varioussuits requesting a declaratory judgment that the directors\' and officers\'liability insurance policies for excess coverage was invalid andor had beenproperly canceled by the carriers or have advised Sunbeam of their intent todeny coverage under such policies. The Company intends to pursue recovery fromall of its insurers if damages are awarded against the Company or itsindemnified officers andor directors under any of the foregoing actions and torecover attorneys\' fees covered under those policies. The Company\'s failure toobtain such insurance recoveries following an adverse judgment against theCompany on any of the foregoing actions could have a material adverse effect onthe Company\'s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Amounts accrued for litigation matters represent the anticipated costs(damages andor settlement amounts) in connection with pending litigation andclaims and related anticipated legal fees. The costs are accrued when it is bothprobable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred andthe amount can be reasonably estimated. The accruals are based upon theCompany\'s assessment, after consultation with counsel, of probable loss based onthe facts and circumstances of each case, the legal issues involved, the natureof the claim made, the nature of the damages sought and <PAGE>any relevant information about the plaintiff, and other significant factorswhich vary by case. When it is not possible to estimate a specific expectedamount of loss to be incurred, the Company evaluates the range of possiblelosses and records the minimum end of the range. As of June , the Companyhad established accruals for litigation matters of . million (representing. million and . million for estimated damages or settlement amounts andlegal fees, respectively) and . million as of December , (representing . million and . million for estimated damages orsettlements and legal fees, respectively.) It is anticipated that the .million accrual will be paid as follows: . million in , . million in and . million in . The Company believes, based on facts known to theCompany at June , , that anticipated probable costs of litigation mattersexisting as of June , have been adequately reserved to the extentdeterminable. As a consumer goods manufacturer and distributor, the Company faces theconstant risks of product liability and related lawsuits involving claims forsubstantial money damages, product recall actions and higher than anticipatedrates of warranty returns or other returns of goods. These claims could resultin liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\'sfinancial position, results of operations and cash flows. Some of the productlines the Company acquired in the acquisitions have increased its exposureto product liability and related claims. The Company and its subsidiaries are also involved in various lawsuitsfrom time to time that Sunbeam considers to be ordinary routine litigationincidental to its business. In the opinion of the Company, the resolution ofthese routine matters, and of matters relating to prior operations, individuallyor in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the financialposition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. See Note to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Effective January , , the Company adopted Statement of Position-, ACCOUNTING FOR THE COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPED OR OBTAINED FORINTERNAL USE (""SOP -""). SOP - requires computer software costs associatedwith internal use software to be expensed as incurred until certaincapitalization criteria are met. Adoption of this statement did not have amaterial impact on the Company\'s consolidated financial position, results ofoperations, or cash flows. In June , the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statementof Financial Accounting Standards No. (""SFAS No. ""), ACCOUNTING FORDERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, which, as amended, is effectivefor fiscal years beginning after June , . SFAS No. requires therecognition of all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as eitherassets or liabilities measured at fair value. The Company has not yet determinedthe impact SFAS No. will have on its consolidated financial position,results of operations, or cash flows.YEAR READINESS DISCLOSURE The Company is preparing for the impact of the Year on itsoperations. Year issues could include potential problems in the informationtechnology (""IT"") and non-IT systems that the Company uses in its operations andproblems in the Company\'s products. Year system failures could affectroutine but critical operations such as forecasting, purchasing, production,order processing, inventory control, shipping, billing and collection. Inaddition, system failures could affect the Company\'s security, payrolloperations, or employee safety. The Company may also be exposed to potentialrisks from third parties with whom the Company interacts who fail to adequatelyaddress their own Year issues.SUNBEAM\'S APPROACH TO YEAR ISSUES While the Company\'s Year readiness planning has been underway forover one year, during the third quarter of the Company established across-functional project team consisting of senior managers, assisted by threeexternal consulting firms which were retained to provide consulting services andto assist the Company in implementing its Year strategy. This team issponsored by the Company\'s Chief Financial Officer who reports directly to theCompany\'s Chief Executive Officer on this issue. The Audit Committee of theBoard of Directors is advised periodically on the status of the Company\'s Year readiness program. <PAGE> The Year project team has developed a phased approach to identifyand resolve Year issues with many of these activities conducted inparallel. The Company\'s approach and the anticipated timing of each phase aredescribed below. PHASE - INVENTORY AND ASSESSMENT: During the first phase of Sunbeam\'sYear readiness program, the Company established a Year ProgramManagement Office (""PMO"") to centralize the management of all of the Company\'sYear projects. Through this office, the Company developed a corporate-wide,uniform strategy for assessing and addressing the Year issues. The Company has completed an inventory of its hardware and softwaresystems, manufacturing equipment, electronic data interchange,telecommunications and other technical assets potentially subject to Year problems, such as security systems and controls for lighting, air conditioning,ventilation and facility access. This inventory was then entered into theCompany\'s Year database along with a determination of the item\'s level ofcriticality to operations. For those inventory items anticipated to have asignificant effect on the business if not corrected, the Company\'s Year program envisions repair or replacement and testing of such items. Allinformation relative to each item is being tracked in the Company\'s Year database. The Company completed most of this phase during the third and fourthquarters of . The Company has completed a review of the readiness ofembedded microprocessors in its products and determined that none of theCompany\'s products have Year date sensitive systems. PHASE - CORRECTION AND TESTING: The second phase of Sunbeam\'s Year readiness program is structured to replace, upgrade or remediate (asnecessary) those items identified during Phase as requiring corrective action. Sunbeam relies on its IT functions to perform many tasks that arecritical to its operations. Significant transactions that could be impacted bynot being ready for any Year issues include, among others, purchases ofmaterials, production management, order entry and fulfillment, payrollprocessing and billings and collections. Systems and applications that have beenidentified by Sunbeam to date as not currently Year ready and which arecritical to Sunbeam\'s operations include its financial software systems, whichprocess the order entry, purchasing, production management, general ledger,accounts receivable, and accounts payable functions, payroll applications, andcritical applications in the Company\'s manufacturing and distributionfacilities, such as warehouse management applications. Recognizing how dependentthe entire company is on IT, Sunbeam decided in to replace its primarybusiness applications with a uniform international business and accountinginformation system to address the systems or applications listed above as wellas to improve internal reporting processes. Based upon representations from themanufacturer that the current version of this uniform information system is Year ready, the Company has been actively upgrading its business sites thatcurrently utilize this uniform system to the Year ready version. Inaddition to the pre-acquisition Sunbeam locations which had already utilized anearlier non-Year ready version of this uniform business and accountinginformation system, Eastpak, Mr. Coffee, Health-o-Meter and Sunbeam LatinAmerica are replacing their current non-Year ready systems with this newuniform system. In addition, Coleman Europe is also replacing key businesscomponents with this new system. The Company is also actively replacing andor upgrading a number ofbusiness systems that are not Year ready, including those that uselocalized business system packages which were not candidates to be replaced bythe uniform business and accounting information system. For example, at Colemanapproximately , mainframe software programs that are used in lieu ofSunbeam\'s uniform business and accounting information system have beenremediated and tested to be Year ready. With respect to the Company\'snon-IT systems (for example, time and attendance, security, and in-linemanufacturing hardware) the Company is actively analyzing these items to assessany Year issues. To date, no material issues have been discovered, and theCompany will continue to review, test and correct, if necessary, such items. Sunbeam has largely implemented the corrective work described above andexpects to complete final testing and implementation of such systems in thethird quarter and early fourth quarter of . PHASE - CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS: The third phaseof Sunbeam\'s Year readiness program which was initiated during the thirdand fourth quarters of is designed to assess and interact with theCompany\'s customers, suppliers, and business partners. As part of this effort,the Company surveyed , vendors and suppliers, a portion of which did notprovide an initial response. During the first half of , ""high risk"" vendorswere contacted directly and the number of non-respondents has since decreasedsubstantially. In fact, currently only of the Company\'s vendors who weresurveyed are categorized as ""high risk"" which includes non-respondents. Based onthe most recent responses to the survey and continued evaluation, the Companybelieves that there is only a low to a medium risk of Year issues for theremaining vendors. The Company will continue to monitor the Year progressof the <PAGE>""high risk"" vendors and has re-surveyed these companies to determine theappropriate course of action. Furthermore, the Company is in the process ofcontacting alternate vendors who are Year ready to replace critical vendorsdeemed ""high risk"" in the event that these vendors are not found to be Year ready. The Company is in the process of completing a verification of the Year survey responses for the most critical vendors to the Company. Sunbeam has responded to numerous customer inquiries about theCompany\'s Year readiness. The Company has verified that all of theCompany\'s major customers have planned programs to deal with Year issuesand is currently completing the process of contacting its major customers toconfirm they are implementing their planned programs to address Year issues. In order to improve the Company\'s communication with its customers,suppliers and business partners, the Company has set up a Sunbeam Year telephone number and is providing Year information on a Company web site. PHASE - CONTINGENCY PLANNING: This phase involves contingencyplanning for unresolved Year issues, particularly any issues arising withthird party suppliers. The Company\'s Year readiness program is ongoing andits ultimate scope, as well as the consideration of contingency plans, willcontinue to be evaluated as new information becomes available. The Company hasdesigned its Year contingency plan and is in the process of implementingit. The development of the contingency plan included a process whereby theCompany\'s critical IT and non-IT systems were evaluated for Year readiness.As a result of this evaluation, the Company does not expect to requireadditional operational equipment or significant process contingency measures.Although the Company does not currently believe there is significant riskassociated with its third party suppliers, the contingency plan includes thecontinuing evaluation of the readiness of the Company\'s suppliers andconsideration of the Company\'s inventory requirements to protect against supplydisruption. This evaluation process may result in an increase in inventoryduring the later months of .THE RISKS OF SUNBEAM\'S YEAR APPROACH The independent consultants assisting the Company in its Year readiness program have reviewed and concurred with the Company\'s approach, haveassisted in developing cost estimates and have monitored costs for the largestsingle component (upgrade or installation of the Company\'s uniform system) ofthe Company\'s Year program. Since Sunbeam\'s Year program was developedand is monitored with the help of independent consultants, the Company did notengage another independent third party to verify the program\'s overall approachor total cost as the Company believes that the Company\'s exposure in this regardis mitigated. In addition, through the use of external third-party diagnosticsoftware packages that are designed to analyze the Year readiness ofbusiness software programs, the Company was able to identify potential Year issues at Coleman. Given this, the Company believes that it has also mitigatedits risk by validating and verifying key program components. Management believes that, although there are significant systems thatare being modified or replaced, including the uniform business and accountinginformation system, Sunbeam\'s information systems environment will be made Year ready prior to January , . Sunbeam\'s failure to timely complete suchcorrective work could have a material adverse impact on the Company. With respect to customers, suppliers and business partners, the failureof certain of these third parties to become Year ready could also have amaterial adverse impact on Sunbeam. For example, the failure of certain of theCompany\'s principal suppliers to have Year ready internal systems couldimpact the Company\'s ability to manufacture andor ship its products or tomaintain adequate inventory levels for production. At this time, the Company believes that the most likely ""worst-case""scenario relating to Year involves potential disruptions in areas in whichthe Company\'s operations must rely on third parties, such as suppliers, whosesystems may not work properly after January , . While such system failurescould either directly or indirectly affect important operations of the Companyand its subsidiaries in a significant manner, the Company cannot at presentestimate either the likelihood or the potential cost of such failures. Subjectto the nature of the goods or services provided to the Company by third partieswhose operations are not made ready for Year issues, the impact onSunbeam\'s operations could be material if appropriate contingency plans cannotbe developed prior to January , . The nature and focus of the Company\'s efforts to address the Year problem may be revised periodically as interim goals are achieved or new issuesare identified. In addition, it is important to note that the description of theCompany\'s efforts and assessments necessarily involves estimates and projectionswith respect to activities required in the future. These estimates andprojections are subject to change as work continues, and such changes may besubstantial. <PAGE>THE COSTS TO ADDRESS THE COMPANY\'S YEAR ISSUES Through the first half of , including costs incurred in ,Sunbeam had expended approximately million to address Year issues ofwhich approximately was recorded as capital expenditures and the remainderas SG&A expense. Sunbeam\'s current assessment of the total costs to address andremedy Year issues and enhance its operating systems, including costs forthe acquired companies, is approximately million. This estimate includes thefollowing categories: o uniform international business and accounting systems million o localized business system software upgrades and remediation million o Year readiness assessment and tracking million o upgrade of personal computers and related software million The amount to be incurred for Year issues during ofapproximately million represents over of the Company\'s total budgetfor information systems and related support, including Year costs. A largemajority of these costs are expected to be incremental expenditures that willnot recur in the Year or thereafter. Fees and expenses related to thirdparty consultants, who are involved in the PMO as well as the modification andreplacement of software, represent approximately of the total estimatedcost. The balance of the total estimated cost relates primarily to softwarelicense fees and new hardware, but excludes the costs associated with Companyemployees. Sunbeam expects these expenditures to be financed through operatingcash flows or borrowings, as applicable. A significant portion of theseexpenditures will enhance Sunbeam\'s operating systems in addition to resolvingthe Year issues. As Sunbeam completes its assessment of the Year issues, the actual expenditures incurred or to be incurred may differ materiallyfrom the amounts shown above. The bank credit facility does not permit theCompany to spend more than million on Year testing and remediation in. Because Year readiness is critical to the business, Sunbeam hasredeployed some resources from non-critical system enhancements to address Year issues, thereby deferring the non-critical systems enhancements. TheCompany does not expect these redeployments and deferrals to have a materialimpact on the Company\'s financial condition, results of operations, or cashflows.CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form -QA mayconstitute ""forward-looking"" statements within the meaning of the PrivateSecurities Litigation Reform Act of , as the same may be amended from timeto time (herein the ""Act"") and in releases made by the SEC from time to time.Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertaintiesand other factors which may cause the actual results, performance, orachievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results,performance, or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-lookingstatements.

OTHER INFORMATION Item ."", 'ITEM . MANAGEMENT\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with theaccompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the relatedfootnotes included in this quarterly report on Form -QA, as well as theconsolidated financial statements, related footnotes and management\'s discussionand analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the Company\'sAnnual Report on Form -KA for the year ended December , . ACQUISITIONS On March , , the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary,acquired approximately of the total number of then outstanding shares ofcommon stock of Coleman from a subsidiary of M&F, in exchange for ,,shares of the Company\'s common stock and approximately million in cash. Inaddition, the Company assumed approximately , million in debt. Immediatelythereafter, as a result of the exercise of employee stock options, Sunbeam\'sindirect beneficial ownership of Coleman decreased to approximately of thetotal number of the outstanding shares of Coleman common stock. The Company\'sagreement for the acquisition of the remaining publicly held Coleman sharespursuant to a merger transaction provides that the remaining Colemanshareholders will receive: o approximately . million shares of Sunbeam common stock (. share for each outstanding Coleman share); and, o approximately million in cash (. for each outstanding Coleman share and the cash-out of unexercised Coleman options for an amount equal to the difference between . per share and the exercise price of such options).The Company expects to complete the Coleman merger during the second half of, although there can be no assurance that the merger will occur during thattime. See Note to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements forinformation regarding the settlement claims relating to the Coleman acquisition,the terms of which provide for the issuance at the time of the merger ofwarrants to purchase up to . million shares of Sunbeam\'s common stock at per share. On October , , the Company announced that it had entered into aMemorandum of Understanding to settle, subject to Court approval, class actionclaims made by minority shareholders of Coleman relating to the Coleman merger.Under the terms of the proposed settlement, if approved by the Court, theCompany will issue to the Coleman public shareholders, and plaintiff\'s counselin this action, warrants to purchase up to . million shares of the Company\'scommon stock at a cash exercise price of . per share, subject to certainanti-dilution provisions. These warrants would generally have the same terms asthe warrants issued to a subsidiary of M&F and will be issued when the Colemanmerger is consummated. Issuance of these warrants will be accounted for asadditional purchase consideration. There can be no assurance that the Court willapprove the settlement as proposed. On April , , the Company completed the cash acquisitions of FirstAlert, a leading manufacturer of smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, andSignature Brands, a leading manufacturer of consumer and professional products.The First Alert and the Signature Brands acquisitions were valued atapproximately million (including million of cash and million ofassumed debt) and million (reflecting cash paid, including the requiredretirement or defeasance of debt), respectively. The acquisitions were recorded under the purchase method of accountingand accordingly, the financial position and results of operations of eachacquired entity are included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statementsfrom the respective dates of acquisition. The purchase prices of the acquiredentities have been allocated to individual assets acquired and liabilitiesassumed based on estimates of fair values (determined by independent appraisals)at the dates of acquisition.THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH , COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH , Results of operations for the three months ended March , include the results of the three acquired companies for the entire period as compared to results of operations for the three months ended March , , which only included the results of Coleman from March , . The acquired entities generated net sales of . million for the three months ended March , , with a corresponding gross margin of . million, or . of net sales. Selling, General and Administrative (""SG&A"") costs recorded by the acquired entities were . million in the period, yielding operating income of . million. Results for the first quarter of included net sales from Coleman of approximately million, with a corresponding gross margin of approximately million, and SG&A expenses of approximately million. For the acquired entities, net sales for the three months ended March, were approximately million higher than their results for the fullfirst quarter a year ago. This increase was attributable to increased net salesat Coleman (approximately million) and Signature Brands (approximately million), partially offset by a decrease in net sales at First Alert(approximately million). Excluding the revenue of Coleman\'s safety andsecurity business and spa business, both of which were sold in , Coleman\'snet sales in the first three months of would have been approximately million higher than the same period in . The increase in Coleman net salesis reflective of strong retail replenishment demand in its outdoor recreationproducts as compared with unusually weak retail replenishment demand in thefirst quarter of . Additionally, increased generator revenues attributableto increased awareness of power shortages from poor weather conditions and otherevents contributed to the higher net sales. Excluding: (i) <PAGE>the effects of purchase accounting of approximately million recognized in; (ii) acquisition costs of approximately million which were incurred inthe first quarter of ; and (iii) approximately million of costs recordedin related to Year compliance efforts, operating profit for thesethree companies improved by approximately million as compared to the sameperiod in the prior year, resulting primarily from higher net sales and areduction in expenses largely attributable to reduced headcount and thecentralization of certain management and administration functions, resultingfrom the acquisition by Sunbeam. Consolidated net sales for the three months ended March , were. million, an increase of . million versus the three months endedMarch , . After excluding . million of net sales generated by theacquired entities in the period and approximately million in the period, as discussed above, net sales of . million decreased approximately from net sales of . million in . The Company believes the decreasein product sales were largely driven by increases in retail inventory levelsfrom channel loading which took place in the first quarter of , but not inthe period. The adverse effect of the channel loading was partiallyoffset by lower estimated provisions for customer returns and customerallowances of approximately million. Domestic sales, excluding the acquired companies, declinedapproximately or million from . The Company believes this salesdecline is attributable to the channel loading that took place in the firstquarter of versus no similar loading in the same period in . Thechannel loading that took place in led to relatively lower sales ofappliances, primarily blenders, breadmakers, handmixers and irons in , aswell as lower sales of outdoor cooking products. Partially offsetting theadverse effects of channel loading was a benefit from reduced costs in fromcustomer returns and allowances. International sales, excluding the acquired companies, represented of net sales for and decreased approximately million as compared withthe net sales for the same period a year ago. The Company believes this salesdecline was largely attributable to the previously discussed impact ofincreasing retail inventory levels in the first quarter of . Sales were alsoadversely impacted in by a decision to stop selling to certain exportdistributors in Latin America. Additionally, poor economic conditions in thatregion contributed to lower sales in . Excluding the effect of the gross margin generated from the inclusionof the acquired entities\' operations of . million in and approximately million in , as discussed above, gross margin was . million or .of sales for versus a gross margin of . million or . of net salesfor . Lower sales volume and unfavorable manufacturing efficienciesresulting from lower production levels in accounted for approximately million of the change between years. This was partially offset by a lowerrelative rate of product returns, reduced customer allowances of approximately million, and improved product mix of approximately million during thefirst quarter of as compared to the same period in . Excluding the effects of: (i) . million of SG&A charges in andapproximately million in resulting from the inclusion of the acquiredentities; (ii) approximately million of compensation expense recordedin connection with new employment agreements with the three former seniorofficers; (iii) a . million benefit in from the reversal of reserves nolonger required, and (iv) . million of costs recorded in the periodrelated to Year compliance efforts, SG&A expenses were approximately .million in the first quarter of , . higher than the same period in .This increase of approximately million is primarily due to an increase incorporate administrative costs of approximately million, reflectingadditional personnel and related relocation, travel and related costs andincreases in postretirement benefit costs. Increases in insurance and highercosts associated with outside services account for the remainder of the increasein SG&A. Operating results for the first quarters of and for theSunbeam business before the acquisitions on a comparable basis as describedabove, were a loss of . million in and a loss of . million in .On the same basis, operating margins as a percent of net sales decreased to aloss of . from a loss of . in the prior year. This change resulted fromthe factors discussed above. Interest expense increased from . million in the first quarter of to . million in the first quarter of primarily related to higherborrowing levels in resulting from borrowings for the acquisitions thatwere outstanding for the entire quarter. Other expense, net of . million for the first three months of included approximately . million relating to liquidating damages expensedrelated to holders of the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Subordinated Debenturesdue (the ""Debentures"") (see Note to the condensed consolidated financialstatements), partially offset by favorable foreign exchange. Other expense, netof . million for the first three months of primarily represents foreignexchange losses, largely arising from Sunbeam\'s operations in Mexico. The minority interest reported in relates to the minority interestheld in Coleman by minority shareholders. The Company provided for deferred tax expense in primarily due totaxable income in foreign jurisdictions. Deferred tax assets resulting fromoperating losses, incurred predominantly in domestic jurisdictions, wererecorded and valuation allowances were established for substantially all suchdeferred tax assets. The Company\'s losses and related valuation allowancescaused the reported tax rate to differ from the statutory rate. On July , , the Company acquired ,, shares of a newlycreated series of Coleman voting preferred stock for an aggregate purchase priceof approximately million. These shares, together with the shares of Colemancommon stock the Company owns, enable Sunbeam to exercise . of the totalvoting power of Coleman\'s outstanding capital stock as of July , . Thisclass of preferred stock was created by Coleman and acquired by the Company inorder to enable Coleman and the Company to file <PAGE>consolidated federal income tax returns, and in certain jurisdictions,consolidated state income tax returns, prior to the consummation of the Colemanmerger. In connection with the issuance of the shares of preferred stock, theCompany entered into a tax sharing agreement with Coleman, pursuant to whichColeman will pay to Sunbeam amounts equal to the federal and state income taxesthat would have been payable by Coleman had Coleman not been included in theconsolidated income tax return of the Company. The net proceeds from theissuance of the shares by Coleman of its voting preferred stock to ColemanWorldwide were used by Coleman to make a partial repayment of loans outstandingfrom Sunbeam under the Intercompany Note. (See Note to the CondensedConsolidated Financial Statements.) In , the Company prepaid an industrialrevenue bond related to its Hattiesburg facility. In connection with this earlyextinguishment of debt, the Company recognized an extraordinary charge of .million, consisting primarily of redemption premiums (. million) andunamortized deferred financing costs (. million).FOREIGN OPERATIONS Approximately of the Company\'s business is conducted in U.S. dollars (including both domestic sales, U.S. dollar denominated export sales, primarily to certain Latin American markets, Asian sales and the majority of European sales). The Company\'s non-U.S. dollar denominated sales are made principally by subsidiaries in Europe, Canada, Japan, Latin America and Mexico. Mexico reverted to a hyperinflationary status for accounting purposes in ; therefore, translation adjustments related to Mexican net monetary assets were included as a component of net (loss) earnings. Mexico is not considered hyperinflationary as of January , . This change in Mexico\'s hyperinflationary status is not expected to have a material effect on the Company\'s financial results. Translation adjustments resulting from the Company\'s non-U.S. denominated subsidiaries have not had a material impact on the Company\'s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. While revenues generated in Asia have traditionally not beensignificant, economic instability in this region is expected to have a negativeeffect on earnings. Economic instability and the political environment in LatinAmerica have also affected sales in that region. It is anticipated that sales inand exports to these regions will continue to be impacted so long as theeconomic environments in those regions remain unsettled. On a limited basis, the Company selectively uses derivatives (foreignexchange option and forward contracts) to manage foreign exchange exposures thatarise in the normal course of business. No derivative contracts are entered intofor trading or speculative purposes. The use of derivatives has not had amaterial impact on the Company\'s financial results.SEASONALITY Sunbeam\'s consolidated sales are not expected to exhibit substantialseasonality; however, sales are expected to be strongest during the secondquarter of the calendar year. Furthermore, sales of a number of products,including warming blankets, vaporizers, humidifiers, grills, First Alertproducts, camping and generator products may be impacted by unseasonable weatherconditions.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESDEBT INSTRUMENTS In order to finance the acquisition of Coleman, First Alert andSignature Brands and to refinance substantially all of the indebtedness of theCompany and the three acquired companies, the Company consummated an offering inMarch of zero coupon debentures having a yield to maturity of (approximately , million principal amount at maturity), which resulted inapproximately million of net proceeds and borrowed about , millionunder its new bank credit facility. The debentures are exchangeable for shares of the Company \'s commonstock at an initial conversion rate of . shares for each , principalamount at maturity of the debentures, subject to adjustments upon occurrence ofspecified events. The debentures are subordinated in right of payment to allexisting and future senior indebtedness of the Company. The debentures are notredeemable by the Company prior to March , . On or after such date, thedebentures are redeemable for cash with at least days notice, at the optionof the Company. The Company is required to purchase debentures at the option ofthe holder as of March , , March , and March , , at purchaseprices equal to the issue price plus accrued original discount to such dates.Sunbeam may, at its option, elect to pay any such purchase price in cash orcommon stock or any combination thereof. However, the bank credit facilityprohibits the Company from redeeming or repurchasing debentures for cash. TheCompany was required to file a registration statement with the SEC to registerthe debentures by June , . This registration statement was filed onFebruary , and the SEC has not declared the registration statementeffective. The Company \'s failure to file the registration statement by June , did not constitute default under the terms of the debentures. As part ofthe normal review process by the SEC, a number of comments have been made by thestaff of the Division of Corporation Finance relating to the registrationstatement and the restated and financial statements included therein.The Company has filed amendments to this registration statement. From June , until the registration statement is declared effective, the Company isrequired to pay to the debenture holders cash liquidated damages accruing, foreach day during such period, at a rate per annum equal to . during the first days and . thereafter multiplied by the total of the issue price of thedebentures plus the original issue discount thereon on such day. The Companymade its first payment of approximately , to the debenture holders onSeptember , and an additional million was paid on March , . Anadditional cash payment of <PAGE>approximately million, representing the Company\'s liability to debentureholders through June , , was paid on September , . Concurrent with the acquisitions, the Company replaced its millionsyndicated unsecured five-year revolving credit facility with the bank creditfacility. The bank credit facility provided for aggregate borrowings of up to. billion and in addition to other customary covenants, required the Companyto maintain specified consolidated leverage, interest coverage and fixed chargecoverage ratios as of the end of each fiscal quarter occurring after March , and on or prior to the latest stated maturity date for any of theborrowings under the bank credit facility. As a result of, among other things, its operating losses incurredduring the first half of , the Company did not achieve the specifiedfinancial ratios for June , and it appeared unlikely that the Companywould achieve the specified financial ratios for September , .Consequently, the Company and its lenders entered into an agreement dated as ofJune , that waived through December , all defaults arising fromthe failure of the Company to satisfy the specified financial ratios for June, and September , . Pursuant to an agreement with the Company datedas of October , , the Company \'s lenders extended all of the waivers underthe June agreement through April , and also waived through such dateall defaults arising from any failure by the Company to satisfy the specifiedfinancial ratios for December , . As part of the October , agreement, the Company agreed to a minimum monthly earnings before interest,taxes, depreciation and amortization (""EBITDA"") covenant (as defined in the bankcredit facility) which covenant the Company had been able to satisfy. On April , , among other things, the lenders extended all of thewaivers set forth in the October , agreement through April , . OnApril , , the Company and its lenders entered into a comprehensiveamendment to the bank credit facility that, among other things, extended all ofthe waivers under the April , agreement until April , and waiveduntil such date all defaults arising from any failure by the Company to satisfythe specified financial ratios for any fiscal quarter end occurring during and for March , . Following is a description of the significant terms ofthe bank credit facility as amended April , . As part of the April , bank credit facility amendment, the Company agreed to a minimum cumulativeEBITDA covenant that is based on post-December , consolidated EBITDA andis tested at the end of each month occurring on or prior to March , , aswell as a covenant limiting the amount of revolving loans (other than those usedto fund the Coleman merger) that may be outstanding under the bank creditfacility as of the end of each such month. The minimum cumulative EBITDA wasinitially . million for the period January , through April , andgenerally grows on a monthly basis until it reaches . million for theperiod from January , through March , .The bank credit facility provides for aggregate borrowings of up to . billionthrough: o a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to . million maturing March , , . million of which may only be used to complete the Coleman merger; o up to . million in term loans maturing on March , , of which . million may only be used to complete the Coleman merger; and o a . million term loan maturing September , , of which . million has already been repaid through June , . As of March , , approximately . billion was outstanding andapproximately . billion was available for borrowing under the bank creditfacility. The remaining . billion of the . billion bank credit facilitywas committed for outstanding letters of credit. Under the bank credit facility, interest accrues, at the Company \'soption: o at the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR""); o or at the base rate of the administrative agent which is generally the higher of the prime commercial lending rate of the administrative agent or the Federal Funds Rate plus .;in each case plus an interest margin which is currently . for LIBORborrowings and . for base rate borrowings. The interest margin is subject topotential decreases in the future, including a decrease to . for LIBOR loansand . for base rate loans upon consummation of the Coleman merger and theeffectiveness of the pledge of substantially all of Coleman\'s and its domesticsubsidiaries\' assets to secure the obligations under the bank credit facility. Under the terms of the April , amendment to the bank creditfacility, the Company is obligated to pay the bank lenders a loan commitment feeof between . to . of the commitments under the bank credit facility asof April , . The percentage used to calculate the fee will be determinedby reference to the bank lenders\' aggregate commmitments and loan exposure underthe bank credit facility as they may be reduced on or before September , .The fee is payable on the earlier of September , and the date thecommitments are terminated and the loans and other amount payable under the bankcredit facility are repaid. (See Note to the Condensed Consolidated FinancialStatements.) <PAGE> Borrowings under the bank credit facility are secured by a pledge ofthe stock of the Company\'s material subsidiaries, including Coleman, and by asecurity interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company and itsmaterial domestic subsidiaries, other than Coleman and its material subsidiariesexcept as described below. Currently, Coleman\'s inventory and related assets arepledged to secure its obligations for letters of credit issued for its accountunder the bank credit facility. Additionally, as security for Coleman\'s notepayable to the Company, Coleman pledged substantially all of its domesticassets, other than real property, including of the stock of its directforeign subsidiaries and domestic holding companies for its foreign subsidiariesand all of the stock of its other direct domestic subsidiaries but not theassets of Coleman\'s subsidiaries. The pledge runs in favor of the Company \'slending banks, to which the Coleman note has been pledged as security for theCompany \'s obligations to them. Upon completion of the Coleman merger,substantially all of Coleman\'s assets and the assets of Coleman\'s domesticsubsidiaries will be pledged to secure the obligations under the bank creditfacility. In addition, borrowings under the bank credit facility are guaranteedby a number of the Company \'s wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries andthese subsidiary guarantees are secured as described above. Upon completion ofthe Coleman merger, Coleman and each of its United States subsidiaries willbecome guarantors of the obligations under the bank credit facility. To theextent extensions of credit are made to any subsidiaries of the Company, theobligations of such subsidiaries are guaranteed by the Company. In addition to the above described financial ratios and tests, the bankcredit facility contains covenants customary for credit facilities of a similarnature, including limitations on the ability of the Company and itssubsidiaries, including Coleman, to, among other things: o declare dividends or repurchase stock; o prepay, redeem or repurchase debt, incur liens and engage in sale-leaseback transactions; o make loans and investments; o incur additional debt (including revolving loans under the bank credit facility); o amend or otherwise alter material agreements or enter into restrictive agreements; o make capital and Year compliance expenditures; o engage in mergers, acquisitions and asset sales; o engage in transactions with specified affiliates; o settle specified litigation; o alter its cash management system; and o alter the businesses they conduct.Sunbeam is also required to comply with specified financial covenants andratios. The bank credit facility provides for events of default customary fortransactions of this type, including nonpayment, misrepresentation, breach ofcovenant, cross-defaults, bankruptcy, material adverse change arising fromcompliance with ERISA, material adverse judgments, entering into guarantees andchange of ownership and control. It is also an event of default under the bankcredit facility if the Company \'s registration statement in connection with theColeman merger is not declared effective by the SEC on or before October , (effective as of October , , the bank lenders agreed to extend thisdate to November , ), or if the merger does not occur within businessdays of the effectiveness of the registration statement or if the cashconsideration--including any payments on account of the exercise of anyappraisal rights, but excluding related legal, accounting and other customaryfees and expenses--to consummate the Coleman merger exceeds . million.Although there can be no assurance, the Company anticipates that it will satisfythese conditions. Furthermore, the bank credit facility requires the Company toprepay term loans under the bank credit facility on each of September , and December , to the extent that cash on hand in the Company \'sconcentration accounts plus the aggregate amount of unused revolving loancommitments on these dates (excluding, for the September measurement date, .million reserved for the Coleman merger), exceeds million and million,respectively, but the Company is not required to prepay more than . millionin the aggregate as a result of the provision. Unless waived by the bank lenders, the failure of the Company tosatisfy any of the financial ratios and tests contained in the bank creditfacility or the occurrence of any other event of default under the bank creditfacility would entitle the bank lenders to (a) receive a . increase in theinterest rate applicable to outstanding loans and increase the trade letter ofcredit fees to . and (b) accelerate the maturity of the outstandingborrowings under the bank credit facility and exercise all or any of their otherrights and remedies. Any such acceleration or other exercise of rights andremedies would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company. The bank credit facility also includes provisions for the deferral ofthe scheduled term loan payments of . million until April , as aresult of the satisfaction by the Company on May , of the agreed uponconditions to the deferral. (See Note to the Condensed Consolidated FinancialStatements.)CASH FLOWS As of March , , the Company had cash and cash equivalents of. million, working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents of .million and total debt of . billion. Cash used in operating activities duringthe first quarter of was . million compared to . million in thefirst quarter of . This change is primarily attributable to working capitalimprovements partially offset by lower earnings after giving effect to non-cashcharges. The majority of the working capital improvements are attributable <PAGE>the Company\'s management of inventory levels and accounts receivable.Inventories and receivables increased . million and . million,respectively, in the first quarter of as compared to . million and. million, respectively, in the first quarter of . In , the Companybuilt inventory levels in anticipation of sales volumes that did not materializeand offered extended credit terms to its customers. The increase in inventoryduring the first quarter of is largely due to the seasonal inventory buildin the Company\'s Outdoor Leisure division. The Company participates in anaccounts receivable securitization program to finance a portion of its accountsreceivable. (See Note of Notes to Condensed Consolidated FinancialStatements.) In the first quarter of , cash used in investing activities wasdriven by capital expenditures of . million, primarily for informationsystems and equipment and tooling for new products. Capital spending in thecomparable period was . million and was primarily for capacityexpansion initiatives, including the Neosho grill manufacturing facility, andequipment and tooling for new products. The new product capital spending in the period principally related to the appliance category and included costsrelated to water and air filtration products, blenders, standmixers and irons.Cash used in investing activities in the first quarter of reflects .million for the acquisition of approximately of Coleman. The Companyanticipates capital spending to be approximately to of net sales,primarily related to information systems and related support, includingexpenditures for Year readiness, new product introductions and capacityadditions. Cash provided by financing activities totaled . million in thefirst quarter of and reflects net borrowings under the Company\'s New CreditFacility. Cash provided by financing activities in the first quarter of was. million and reflects net proceeds from the Debentures of . million,the cancellation and repayment of all outstanding balances under the Company\'s million September revolving credit facility, the repayment of certainColeman debt and the early extinguishment of the . million Hattiesburg bond.In addition, cash provided by financing activities is net of . million offinancing fees related to the Company\'s . billion New Credit Facility and. million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. (See Note to theCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements.) At March , , standby and commercial letters of credit aggregated. million and were predominately for insurance, pension, environmental,workers\' compensation, and international trade activities. In addition, as ofMarch , , surety bonds with a contract value of . million wereoutstanding largely for the Company\'s pension plans and as a result oflitigation judgments that are currently under appeal. For additional informationrelating to the debentures, the bank credit facility and the repayment of debt,see Note to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company expects to acquire the remaining equity interest in Colemanpursuant to a merger transaction in which the existing Coleman minorityshareholders will receive . of a share of the Company\'s common stock, .in cash for each share of Coleman common stock outstanding and warrants topurchase common stock of the Company at a cash exercise price of . pershare. In addition, unexercised options under Coleman\'s stock option plans willbe cashed out at a price per share equal to the difference between . andthe exercise price of such options. The Company expects to issue approximately. million shares of common stock and expend approximately million in cash,including cash paid to option holders, to complete the Coleman transaction.Under a proposed settlement of certain litigation relating to the Colemanmerger, the Company will also issue warrants to purchase up to . millionshares of the Company\'s common stock to the Coleman public stockholders and theplaintiff\'s litigation counsel upon consummation of the Coleman merger.Althoughthere can be no assurance, it is anticipated that the Coleman merger will occurin the second half of fiscal . The Company believes its borrowing capacity under the New CreditFacility, cash flow from the combined operations of the Company and its acquiredcompanies, existing cash and cash equivalent balances, and its receivablesecuritization program will be sufficient to support working capital needs,capital and Year compliance spending, and debt service through April ,. The Company intends to negotiate with its lenders on an amendment to theNew Credit Facility, negotiate with its lenders on further waiver of suchcovenants and other terms or refinance the New Credit Facility. Any decisionswith respect to such amendment, waiver, or refinancing will be made based on areview from time to time of the advisability of particular transactions. Therecan be no assurance that an amendment, further waiver of existing covenants andother terms, or refinancing will be entered into by April , . The failureto obtain such an amendment, further waiver or debt refinancing would likelyresult in violation of the existing covenants and compliance with other terms,which would permit the bank lenders to accelerate the maturity of alloutstanding borrowings under the New Credit Facility. Accordingly, debt relatedto the New Credit Facility and all debt containing cross-default provisions willbe classified as current in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet in thesecond quarter of . In May , the NYSE advised the Company that it did not meet thecontinuing listing standards of the NYSE because the Company did not havetangible net assets of at least million and average annual net income of atleast . million for , and . Representatives from the Company metwith NYSE officials, and in March , the NYSE informed the Company that theCompany\'s common stock would not be delisted at that time, although the NYSEwould, however, continue to monitor Sunbeam\'s financial condition andoperations. On August , , the NYSE advised the Company that the NYSE hadrevised its continuing listing standards, and that the Company is in compliancewith the revised standards. In April , the NYSE advised Coleman that it did not meet the NYSE\'scontinuing listing standards because Coleman did not have tangible net assets ofat least million as of September , and average annual net income ofat least . million for , and . At that time, Coleman requestedthe NYSE to continue to list the Coleman common stock until completion of themerger. The NYSE subsequently advised Coleman that Coleman also failed tosatisfy certain non-financial continuing listing standards. <PAGE>On August , , the NYSE advised Coleman that the NYSE had revised itscontinuing listing standards, and that Coleman is in compliance with the revisedfinancial standards. Coleman and the NYSE have agreed upon a program wherebyColeman will correct the deficiencies in its non-financial continuing listingstandards by the end of . Coleman is currently complying with such program.If Coleman were to be delisted from the NYSE, it would adversely affectColeman\'s ability to sell its capital stock to third parties or use its capitalstock as collateral for loans. Sunbeam\'s bank credit facility currentlyrestricts Coleman from taking such actions. By letter dated June , , the staff of the Division of Enforcementof the SEC advised the Company that it was conducting an informal inquiry intothe Company \'s accounting policies and procedures and requested that the Companyproduce documents. On July , , the SEC issued a Formal Order of PrivateInvestigation, designating officers to take testimony and pursuant to which asubpoena was served on Sunbeam requiring the production of documents. OnNovember , , the Company received another SEC subpoena requiring theproduction of additional documents. The Company has provided numerous documentsto the SEC staff and continues to cooperate with the SEC staff. The Company has,however, declined to provide the SEC with material that the Company believes issubject to the attorney-client privilege and the work product immunity. TheCompany cannot predict the term of such investigation or its potential outcome. The Company is involved in significant litigation, including class andderivative actions, relating to events which led to the restatement of itsconsolidated financial statements, the issuance of the MacAndrews & Forbeswarrant, the sale of the debentures and the employment agreements of Messrs.Dunlap and Kersh. Sunbeam intends to vigorously defend each of the actions, butcannot predict the outcome and is not currently able to evaluate the likelihoodof the Company \'s success in each case or the range of potential loss. However,if the Company were to lose these suits, judgments would likely have a materialadverse effect on the Company \'s financial position, results of operations andcash flows. Additionally, the Company\'s insurance carriers have filed varioussuits requesting a declaratory judgment that the directors\' and officers\'liability insurance policies for excess coverage was invalid andor had beenproperly canceled by the carriers or have advised Sunbeam of their intent todeny coverage under such policies. The Company intends to pursue recovery fromall of its insurers if damages are awarded against the Company or itsindemnified officers andor directors under any of the foregoing actions and torecover attorneys\' fees covered under those policies. The Company \'s failure toobtain such insurance recoveries following an adverse judgment against theCompany on any of the foregoing actions could have a material adverse effect onthe Company \'s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Amounts accrued for litigation matters represent the anticipated costs(damages andor settlement amounts) in connection with pending litigation andclaims and related anticipated legal fees. The costs are accrued when it is bothprobable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred andthe amount can be reasonably estimated. The accruals are based upon the Company\'s assessment, after consultation with counsel, of probable loss based on thefacts and circumstances of each case, the legal issues involved, the nature ofthe claim made, the nature of the damages sought and any relevant informationabout the plaintiff, and other significant factors which vary by case. When itis not possible to estimate a specific expected amount of loss to be incurred,the Company evaluates the range of possible losses and records the minimum endof the range. As of March , the Company had established accruals forlitigation matters of . million (representing . million and .million for estimated damages or settlement amounts and legal fees,respectively). As of December , , the Company had established accruals forlitigation matters of . million (representing . million and .million for estimated damages or settlements and legal fees, respectively.) Itis anticipated that the . million accrual will be paid as follows: .million in , . million in and . million in . The Companybelieves, based on information known to the Company at March , , thatanticipated probable costs of litigation matters existing as of March , have been adequately reserved to the extent determinable. As a consumer goods manufacturer and distributor, the Company faces theconstant risks of product liability and related lawsuits involving claims forsubstantial money damages, product recall actions and higher than anticipatedrates of warranty returns or other returns of goods. These claims could resultin liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\'sfinancial position and results of operations. Some of the product lines theCompany acquired in the acquisitions have increased its exposure to productliability and related claims. The Company and its subsidiaries are also involved in various lawsuitsfrom time to time that Sunbeam considers to be ordinary routine litigationincidental to its business. In the opinion of the Company, the resolution ofthese routine matters, and of matters relating to prior operations, individuallyor in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the financialposition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. See Note to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Effective January , , the Company adopted Statement of Position-, ACCOUNTING FOR THE COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPED OR OBTAINED FORINTERNAL USE (""SOP -""). SOP - requires computer software costs associatedwith internal use software to be expensed as incurred until certaincapitalization criteria are met. Adoption of this statement did not have amaterial impact on the Company\'s condensed consolidated financial position,results of operations, or cash flows. In June , the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statementof Financial Accounting Standards No. (""SFAS No. ""), ACCOUNTING FORDERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, which is effective for fiscalyears beginning after June , <PAGE>. SFAS No. requires the recognition of all derivatives in theConsolidated Balance Sheets as either assets or liabilities measured at fairvalue. The Company has not yet determined the impact SFAS No. will have onits consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.YEAR READINESS DISCLOSURE The Company is preparing for the impact of the Year on itsoperations. Year issues could include potential problems in the informationtechnology (""IT"") and non-IT systems that the Company uses in its operations andproblems in the Company\'s products. Year system failures could affectroutine but critical operations such as forecasting, purchasing, production,order processing, inventory control, shipping, billing and collection. Inaddition, system failures could affect the Company\'s security, payrolloperations, or employee safety. The Company may also be exposed to potentialrisks from third parties with whom the Company interacts who fail to adequatelyaddress their own Year issues.SUNBEAM\'S APPROACH TO YEAR ISSUES While the Company\'s Year readiness planning has been underway forover one year, during the third quarter of the Company established across-functional project team consisting of senior managers, assisted by threeexternal consulting firms which were retained to provide consulting services andto assist the Company in implementing its Year strategy. This team issponsored by the Company\'s Chief Financial Officer who reports directly to theCompany\'s Chief Executive Officer on this issue. The Audit Committee of theBoard of Directors is advised periodically on the status of the Company\'s Year readiness program. The Year project team has developed a phased approach to identifyand resolve Year issues with many of these activities conducted inparallel. The Company\'s approach and the anticipated timing of each phase aredescribed below. PHASE - INVENTORY AND ASSESSMENT: During the first phase of Sunbeam\'sYear readiness program, the Company established a Year ProgramManagement Office (""PMO"") to centralize the management of all of the Company\'sYear projects. Through this office, the Company developed a corporate-wide,uniform strategy for assessing and addressing the Year issues. The Company has completed an inventory of its hardware and softwaresystems, manufacturing equipment, electronic data interchange,telecommunications and other technical assets potentially subject to Year problems, such as security systems and controls for lighting, air conditioning,ventilation and facility access. This inventory was then entered into theCompany\'s Year database along with a determination of the item\'s level ofcriticality to operations. For those inventory items anticipated to have asignificant effect on the business if not corrected, the Company\'s Year program envisions repair or replacement and testing of such items. Allinformation relative to each item is being tracked in the Company\'s Year database. The Company completed most of this phase during the third and fourthquarters of . The Company has completed a review of the readiness ofembedded microprocessors in its products and determined that none of theCompany\'s products have Year date sensitive systems. PHASE - CORRECTION AND TESTING: The second phase of Sunbeam\'s Year readiness program is structured to replace, upgrade or remediate (asnecessary) those items identified during Phase as requiring corrective action. Sunbeam relies on its IT functions to perform many tasks that arecritical to its operations. Significant transactions that could be impacted bynot being ready for any Year issues include, among others, purchases ofmaterials, production management, order entry and fulfillment, payrollprocessing and billings and collections. Systems and applications that have beenidentified by Sunbeam to date as not currently Year ready and which arecritical to Sunbeam\'s operations include its financial software systems, whichprocess the order entry, purchasing, production management, general ledger,accounts receivable, and accounts payable functions, payroll applications, andcritical applications in the Company\'s manufacturing and distributionfacilities, such as warehouse management applications. Recognizing how dependentthe entire company is on IT, Sunbeam decided in to replace its primarybusiness applications with a uniform international business and accountinginformation system to address the systems or applications listed above as wellas to improve internal reporting processes. Based upon representations from themanufacturer that the current version of this uniform information system is Year ready, the Company has been actively upgrading its business sites thatcurrently utilize this uniform system to the Year ready version. Inaddition to the pre-acquisition Sunbeam locations which had already utilized anearlier non-Year ready version of this uniform business and accountinginformation system, Eastpak, Mr. Coffee, Health-o-Meter and Sunbeam LatinAmerica are replacing their current non-Year ready systems with this newuniform system. In addition, Coleman Europe is also replacing key businesscomponents with this new system. The Company is also actively replacing andor upgrading a number ofbusiness systems that are not Year ready, including those that uselocalized business system packages which were not candidates to be replaced bythe uniform business and accounting information system. For example, at Colemanapproximately , mainframe software programs that are used in lieu ofSunbeam\'s uniform business and accounting information system have beenremediated and tested to be Year ready. With respect to the Company\'snon-IT systems (for example, time and attendance, security, and in-linemanufacturing hardware) the Company is actively analyzing these items to assessany Year issues. To date, no material issues have been discovered, and theCompany will continue to review, test and correct, if necessary, such items. <PAGE> Sunbeam has largely implemented the corrective work described above andexpects to complete final testing and implementation of such systems in thethird quarter and early fourth quarter of . PHASE - CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS: The third phaseof Sunbeam\'s Year readiness program which was initiated during the thirdand fourth quarters of is designed to assess and interact with theCompany\'s customers, suppliers, and business partners. As part of this effort,the Company surveyed , vendors and suppliers, a portion of which did notprovide an initial response. During the first half of , ""high risk"" vendorswere contacted directly and the number of non-respondents has since decreasedsubstantially. In fact, currently only of the Company\'s vendors who weresurveyed are categorized as ""high risk"" which includes non-respondents. Based onthe most recent responses to the survey and continued evaluation, the Companybelieves that there is only a low to a medium risk of Year issues for theremaining vendors. The Company will continue to monitor the Year progressof the ""high risk"" vendors and has re-surveyed these companies to determine theappropriate course of action. Furthermore, the Company is in the process ofcontacting alternate vendors who are Year ready to replace critical vendorsdeemed ""high risk"" in the event that these vendors are not found to be Year ready. The Company is in the process of completing a verification of the Year survey responses for the most critical vendors to the Company. The Company has responded to numerous customer inquiries about theCompany\'s Year readiness. The Company has verified that all of theCompany\'s major customers have planned programs to deal with Year issuesandis currently completing the process of contacting its major customers to confirmthey are implementing their planned programs to address Year issues. Inorder to improve the Company\'s communication with its customers, suppliers andbusiness partners, the Company has set up a Sunbeam Year telephone numberand is providing Year information on a Company web site. PHASE - CONTINGENCY PLANNING: This phase involves contingencyplanning for unresolved Year issues, particularly any issues arising withthird party suppliers. The Company\'s Year readiness program is ongoing andits ultimate scope, as well as the consideration of contingency plans, willcontinue to be evaluated as new information becomes available. The Company hasdesigned its Year contingency plan and is in the process of implementingit. The development of the contingency plan included a process whereby theCompany\'s critical IT and non-IT systems were evaluated for Year readiness.As a result of this evaluation, the Company does not expect to requireadditional operational equipment or significant process contingency measures.Although the Company does not currently believe there is significant riskassociated with its third party suppliers, the contingency plan includes thecontinuing evaluation of the readiness of the Company\'s suppliers andconsideration of the Company\'s inventory requirements to protect against supplydisruption. This evaluation process may result in an increase in inventoryduring the later months of .THE RISKS OF SUNBEAM\'S YEAR APPROACH The independent consultants assisting the Company in its Year readiness program have reviewed and concurred with the Company\'s approach, haveassisted in developing cost estimates and have monitored costs for the largestsingle component (upgrade or installation of the Company\'s uniform system) ofthe Company\'s Year program. Since Sunbeam\'s Year program was developedand is monitored with the help of independent consultants, the Company did notengage another independent third party to verify the program\'s overall approachor total cost as the Company believes that the Company\'s exposure in this regardis mitigated. In addition, through the use of external third-party diagnosticsoftware packages that are designed to analyze the Year readiness ofbusiness software programs, the Company was able to identify potential Year issues at Coleman. Given this, the Company believes that it has also mitigatedits risk by validating and verifying key program components. Management believes that, although there are significant systems thatare being modified or replaced, including the uniform business and accountinginformation system, Sunbeam\'s information systems environment will be made Year ready prior to January , . Sunbeam\'s failure to timely complete suchcorrective work could have a material adverse impact on the Company. With respect to customers, suppliers and business partners, the failureof certain of these third parties to become Year ready could also have amaterial adverse impact on Sunbeam. For example, the failure of certain of theCompany\'s principal suppliers to have Year ready internal systems couldimpact the Company\'s ability to manufacture andor ship its products or tomaintain adequate inventory levels for production. At this time, the Company believes that the most likely ""worst-case""scenario relating to Year involves potential disruptions in areas in whichthe Company\'s operations must rely on third parties, such as suppliers, whosesystems may not work properly after January , . While such system failurescould either directly or indirectly affect important operations of the Companyand its subsidiaries in a significant manner, the Company cannot at presentestimate either the likelihood or the potential cost of such failures. Subjectto the nature of the goods or services provided to the Company by third partieswhose operations are not made ready for Year issues, the impact onSunbeam\'s operations could be material if appropriate contingency plans cannotbe developed prior to January , . The nature and focus of the Company\'s efforts to address the Year problem may be revised periodically as interim goals are achieved or new issuesare identified. In addition, it is important to note that the description of theCompany\'s efforts and assessments necessarily involves estimates and projectionswith respect to activities required in the future. These estimates andprojections are subject to change as work continues, and such changes may besubstantial. <PAGE>THE COSTS TO ADDRESS THE COMPANY\'S YEAR ISSUES During the quarter ended March , , Sunbeam had expendedapproximately million to address Year issues of which approximately was recorded as capital expenditures and the remainder as SG&A expense.Sunbeam\'s current assessment of the total costs to address and remedy Year issues and enhance its operating systems, including costs for the acquiredcompanies, is approximately million. This estimate includes the followingcategories:<TABLE><CAPTION> <S> <C> o uniform international business and accounting systems million o localized business system software upgrades and remediation million o Year readiness assessment and tracking million o upgrade of personal computers and related software million<TABLE> The amount to be incurred for Year issues during ofapproximately million represents over of the Company\'s total budgetfor information systems and related support, including Year costs. A largemajority of these costs are expected to be incremental expenditures that willnot recur in the Year or thereafter. Fees and expenses related to thirdparty consultants, who are involved in the PMO as well as the modification andreplacement of software, represent approximately of the total estimatedcost. The balance of the total estimated cost relates primarily to softwarelicense fees and new hardware, but excludes the costs associated with Companyemployees. Sunbeam expects these expenditures to be financed through operatingcash flows or borrowings, as applicable. A significant portion of theseexpenditures will enhance Sunbeam\'s operating systems in addition to resolvingthe Year issues. As Sunbeam completes its assessment of the Year issues, the actual expenditures incurred or to be incurred may differ materiallyfrom the amounts shown above. The bank credit facility does not permit theCompany to spend more than million on Year testing and remediation in. Because Year readiness is critical to the business, Sunbeam hasredeployed some resources from non-critical system enhancements to address Year issues. In addition, due to the importance of IT systems to the Company\'sbusiness, management has deferred non-critical systems enhancements as much aspossible. The Company does not expect these redeployments and deferrals to havea material impact on the Company\'s financial condition, results of operations,or cash flows.CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form -QA mayconstitute ""forward-looking"" statements within the meaning of the PrivateSecurities Litigation Reform Act of , as the same may be amended from timeto time (herein the ""Act"") and in releases made by the SEC from time to time.Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertaintiesand other factors which may cause the actual results, performance, orachievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results,performance, or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-lookingstatements.

MANAGEMENT\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with theaccompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the relatedfootnotes included in this quarterly report on Form -Q, as well as theconsolidated financial statements, related footnotes and management\'s discussionand analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the Company\'sAnnual Report on Form -KA for the year ended December , .ACQUISITIONS On March , , the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary,acquired approximately of the total number of then outstanding shares ofcommon stock of Coleman from a subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes (""M&F""), inexchange for ,, shares of the Company\'s common stock and approximately million in cash. In addition, the Company assumed approximately ,million in debt. Immediately thereafter, as a result of the exercise of Colemanemployee stock options, Sunbeam\'s indirect beneficial ownership of Colemandecreased to approximately of the total number of the outstanding shares ofColeman common stock. The Company\'s agreement for the acquisition of theremaining publicly held Coleman shares pursuant to a merger transaction providesthat the remaining Coleman shareholders will receive: o approximately . million shares of Sunbeam common stock (. of a share for each outstanding Coleman share); and, o approximately million in cash (. for each outstanding Coleman share and the cash-out of unexercised Coleman employee stock options for an amount equal to the difference between . per share and the exercise price of such options). The Company expects to complete the Coleman merger during the fourthquarter of or early in the first quarter of , although there can be noassurance that the merger will occur during that time. See the discussion belowunder the heading ""Issuance of Warrants to M&F"" for information regarding thesettlement claims relating to the Coleman acquisition, the terms of whichprovide for the issuance at the time of the merger of warrants to purchase up to. million shares of Sunbeam\'s common stock at per share. On April , , the Company completed the cash acquisitions of FirstAlert, a leading manufacturer of smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, andSignature Brands, a leading manufacturer of consumer and professional products.The First Alert and the Signature Brands acquisitions were valued atapproximately million (including million of cash and million ofassumed debt) and approximately million (reflecting cash paid, includingthe required retirement or defeasance of debt), respectively. The acquisitions were recorded under the purchase method of accountingand accordingly, the financial position and results of operations of eachacquired entity are included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statementsfrom the respective dates of acquisition. The purchase prices of the acquiredentities have been allocated to individual assets acquired and liabilitiesassumed based on estimates of fair values determined by independent appraisalsat the dates of acquisition. - -<PAGE>NON-RECURRING CHARGES Consolidated operating results for and were impacted by anumber of largely non-recurring charges.

Certain amounts included in thehistorical results of the acquired companies have been reclassified to conformto the Company\'s presentation. Presentation of these combined results is made toenhance comparability between the periods presented and such amounts are notnecessarily indicative of the combined results that would have occurred hadthese acquisitions been consummated at the beginning of .PROVISION FOR INVENTORY In the second and third quarters of , the Company recorded chargestotaling . million as a result of the following: o Inventories were built during and the first half of in anticipation of sales volumes which did not materialize. As a result, it has been and will continue to be necessary to dispose of some portions of excess inventories at amounts less than cost. Accordingly, during , when the facts and circumstances were known that such sales volume would not materialize, the Company recorded . million in charges (of which . million and . million were recorded in the second and third quarters, respectively) to properly state this inventory at the lower-of-cost-or-market. This inventory primarily related to certain appliances, grills and grill accessories. o A charge of . million was recorded during the second quarter of for excess inventories for raw material and work in process that will not be used due to outsourcing the production of breadmakers, toasters, and some other appliances. - -<PAGE> o In the second quarter of , the Company made the decision to exit certain product lines, primarily air and water filtration products and eliminate some stock keeping units (""SKU\'s"") within existing product lines, primarily relating to appliances, grills and grill accessories. As a result of this decision, a . million charge was recorded during the second quarter of to properly state this inventory at the lower-of-cost-or market. These charges to record excess inventories at thelower-of-cost-or-market were based upon management\'s best estimate of netrealizable value. (See Note to the Condensed Consolidated FinancialStatements.) In addition to the charge taken in , the excess and obsoleteinventory referenced above has impacted the Company\'s operating results inseveral ways, with two primary effects. First, gross margins have been impactedby sales, at below normal prices, of obsolete inventory into non-traditionalchannels and excess inventory into traditional channels. In addition, due to thehigh levels of excess inventory at the end of , the Company\'s usage of itsmanufacturing facilities has been lower than normal, resulting in lower fixedcost absorption, which in turn, reduced gross margins in .ASSET IMPAIRMENT During , management made decisions to outsource or discontinue asubstantial number of products previously made by the Company (principallybreadmakers, toasters and certain other appliances, air and water filtrationproducts and the elimination of some SKU\'s within existing product lines,primarily relating to appliances, grills and grill accessories). As a result,some facilities and equipment held by the Company at such time are either nolonger used or are utilized in a significantly different manner. Accordingly, acharge of . million was recorded in Cost of Goods Sold to write some ofthese assets down to their estimated fair market value. Subsequent to thedecisions made in conjunction with the acquisitions, management decided todiscontinue certain SKU\'s within product lines, principally generators,compressors and propane cylinders. As a result, in the third quarter of ,the Company recorded in Cost of Goods Sold an additional provision forimpairment of fixed assets of . million in an acquired entity relating toassets taken out of service for which there was no remaining value. These assetsare expected to be substantially disposed of by December , . (See Note to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.)PURCHASE ACCOUNTING The Company recorded the acquisitions using the purchase method ofaccounting. In accordance with this accounting method, inventory pertaining tothe acquisitions was recorded at fair value. The fair value of the inventoryexceeded the book value reflected on the balance sheets of the acquiredcompanies as of the respective acquisition dates. The excess of the fair valueof inventory over its pre-acquisition book value was recorded in cost of salesas the inventory was sold. The non-recurring impact of this purchase accountingadjustment was . million and . million in the second and third quartersof , respectively.ISSUANCE OF WARRANTS TO M&F On August , , the Company announced that, following investigationand negotiation conducted by a Special Committee of the Board of Directorsconsisting of four outside directors not affiliated with M&F, the Company hadentered into a settlement agreement with a subsidiary of M&F pursuant to whichthe Company was released from certain threatened claims of M&F and itssubsidiaries arising from the Coleman acquisition and M&F agreed to providecertain management personnel and assistance to the Company in exchange for theissuance to the M&F subsidiary of a warrant expiring August , to purchaseup to million shares of the Company\'s common stock at a cash exercise priceof . per share, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. The Company concludedthat the agreement to issue this warrant did not result in a new measurementdate for the purposes of determining the purchase price for Coleman andaccounted for the issuance of this warrant in the third quarter of as acost of settling a potential claim. Accordingly, a . million non-cash SG&Aexpense was recorded in the third quarter of , based upon a valuationperformed as of August using facts existing at that time. The valuation wasconducted by an independent consultant engaged by the special committee of theboard of directors.FORMER EMPLOYEES\' DEFERRED COMPENSATIONSEVERANCE On February , , the Company entered into new three-yearemployment agreements with its then Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and twoother senior officers of the Company. The new employment agreements providedfor, among other items, the acceleration of vesting of restricted stock and theforfeiture of unvested restricted stock that had - -<PAGE>been granted under the executives\' prior employment agreements, new restrictedstock grants and options to purchase common shares. In addition, the newemployment agreements provided for income tax gross-ups with respect to any taxassessed on the restricted stock grants and acceleration of vesting ofrestricted stock. Total compensation expense recognized in the first quarter of related to these items was approximately million. The Company alsorecognized approximately . million of severance for former employees in thethird quarter of . (See Note to the Condensed Consolidated FinancialStatements.)YEAR AND SYSTEMS INITIATIVES EXPENSES See ""Year Readiness Disclosure"" within this Item II -""Management\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations"".RESTATEMENT RELATED EXPENSES On June , , the Company announced that the Audit Committee wasinitiating a review into the accuracy of the Company\'s prior financialstatements. The Audit Committee\'s review was completed and, as a result of itsfindings, the Company was required to restate its previously issued consolidatedfinancial statements for and and the first quarter of . Inconnection with the restatement efforts, the Company incurred . million ofcosts in the third quarter of principally representing legal and accountingand auditing costs of . million and . million, respectively.OFFICE RELOCATION EXPENSE In , the Company made the decision to relocate the corporateheadquarters and exit several existing building leases in connection with a planto consolidate office space. Accordingly, a charge of . million was recordedin the third quarter primarily related to lease termination fees andcancellation penalties.THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER , COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER, Consolidated net sales for the three months ended September , and were . million and . million respectively, an increase of. million or approximately . This increase was driven primarily by theOutdoor Leisure group where net sales increased . million to . millionin the third quarter of . This increase was predominately driven by strongretail replenishment demand of outdoor recreation products andPowermateregistered trademark generators (aggregating approximately million). The increase in outdoor recreation products and Powermateregisteredtrademark generators is believed to be partially attributable to heightenedconsumer sensitivity to the need for emergency preparedness. This increasedsensitivity is believed to be reflective of a combination of factors includingweather conditions and Year considerations. Outdoor cooking product netsales increases in the period as compared to the third quarter of accounted for the balance of the sales increase. The increase in outdoor cookingproduct sales was largely the result of strong retail conditions. Household netsales increased . million to . million in . After adjusting for theCompany\'s estimate of the effect of reduced shipments in the year ago quarter toallow trade inventories to return to normal levels, which impacted all segments,but which was most significant for the Household segment. Household segmentsales were essentially flat as compared to the third quarter in . Within theHousehold segment, net sales of personal care and health products increased as aresult of a strengthening retail environment largely offset by decreases insales of appliances and timing of First Alert product sales. International netsales increased . million to . million. This increase in net sales waslargely driven by improved net sales in Canada of approximately million,resulting predominantly from strong retail demand for Powermateregisteredtrademark. Net sales increases in Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific, resultingprimarily from increased sales of outdoor recreation products and reduced levelsof sales returns, account for the remainder of the increase in International netsales. Gross margin for the third quarter in was . million or .million higher than the comparable period in . Excluding the effects of non-recurring items, as summarized above under ""Non-Recurring Charges"", grossmargin was . million in the third quarter of . As a percentage of netsales, gross margin improved to approximately in the third quarter of as compared to the third quarter gross margin of approximately and adjusted gross margin of approximately . Three-quarters of the increase ingross margin dollars was generated through higher sales volumes, volume-relatedmanufacturing fixed cost absorption improvements and improvements inmanufacturing performance driven by the Outdoor Leisure group which contributedover of the - -<PAGE>improvement in total gross margin dollars in the third quarter of .Decreases in customer allowances, which are deductions from gross sales toarrive at net sales, along with improvements in the product sales mix accountedfor the remainder of the improvement in gross margin in the third quarter. SG&A expense in the third quarter of was . million,representing a . decrease over the same period in the prior year. Excludingthe effects of non-recurring items, as summarized above under ""Non-RecurringCharges"", SG&A expense for was approximately million higher than thesame period in . The increase in SG&A expense was driven predominantly byhigher net sales during the quarter and costs related to additional personnel,which together account for approximately million. Approximately two-thirdsof this increase is attributable to higher levels of selling and administrativecosts primarily in the Outdoor Leisure and International segments driven byincreased net sales. The remaining increase in SG&A expense is primarily relatedto additional personnel, largely as a result of the Company building staffinglevels to support future growth, a process that commenced in the third quarterof . In addition, SG&A expense in includes costs associated withcertain redundant operations resulting from the Company\'s acquisitionswhich operations the Company is integrating, as well as the decision to bringin-house certain functions that had previously been outsourced. The Company isin the process of fully integrating certain of these functions and expects thatwhen this process has been completed consolidated SG&A expense for thesefunctions will be reduced. Partially offsetting these increases in SG&A expenseare certain expenses which did not reoccur in . These expensesinclude increases associated with restructuring reserve at Coleman(approximately million) and higher bad debt expense (approximately million). Consolidated operating results for the third quarters of and ,were a profit of . million in and a loss of . million in .Operating results, as adjusted, were a profit of . million and a loss of. million in the third quarter of and , respectively. This changeresulted from the factors discussed above. Interest expense, net in the third quarter of was . million ascompared to . million in the same period in the prior year. Approximately of this increase is attributable to higher levels of borrowings during thethird quarter of . The increased level of borrowings was attributable tocapital expenditures since the third quarter of . The balance of theincrease was driven by the amortization of the loan commitment fee(approximately million) the Company is obligated to pay under the terms ofthe New Credit Facility and the debenture expense related to liquidated damagespayable to debenture holders (approximately million).

Other income, net of . million for the third quarter of included a gain of approximately million relating to the sale of the MexicoCity facility. This gain was partially offset by losses from other miscellaneousasset sales of approximately . million. The balance of other income, net in resulted from favorable foreign exchange rates, primarily from theCompany\'s operations in Japan. Other income, net of . million for the thirdquarter of included . million from the settlement of a lawsuit. Thebalance of other income, net in resulted from favorable foreign exchangerates, primarily from Mexico. The minority interest reported for the third quarter of and relates to the minority interest held in Coleman by public shareholders. Tax expense recorded in the third quarter of (. million)related primarily to taxes on foreign income. Income taxes in the third quarterof reflect tax benefits on earnings of foreign operations. No net taxbenefit was recorded due to the Company\'s U.S. losses in either year as it ismanagement\'s assessment that the Company cannot demonstrate that it is morelikely than not that deferred tax assets resulting from these losses would berealized through future taxable income. On July , , the Company acquired ,, shares of a newlycreated series of Coleman voting preferred stock for an aggregate purchase priceof approximately million. These shares, together with the shares of Colemancommon stock the Company owns, enable Sunbeam to exercise . of the totalvoting power of Coleman\'s outstanding capital stock as of July , . Thisclass of preferred stock was created by Coleman and acquired by the Company inorder to enable Coleman and the Company to file consolidated federal income taxreturns, and in certain jurisdictions, consolidated state income tax returns,prior to the consummation of the Coleman merger. In connection with the issuanceof the shares of preferred stock, the Company entered into a tax sharingagreement with Coleman, pursuant to which Coleman will pay to Sunbeam amountsequal to the federal and state income taxes that would have been payable byColeman had Coleman not been included in the consolidated income tax return ofthe Company. The net proceeds from the issuance of the shares by Coleman of itsvoting preferred stock to the Company were used by Coleman to make a partial - -<PAGE>repayment of loans outstanding from Sunbeam under the Intercompany Note. (SeeNote to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.) On November , , the Company announced a plan to divest Eastpak andalso plans to divest certain non-essential assets. Proceeds from these assetssales are estimated to be million and will be primarily used to pay downdebt.NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER , COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER , Net sales for the nine months ended September , and were,. million and ,. million respectively, an increase of .million. Results for the nine months ended September , include Coleman,Signature Brands and First Alert from their respective acquisition dates. Afteradjusting sales to include sales of the acquired companies for the periodsfrom the beginning of through the respective dates of acquisition, combinedhistorical net sales would be ,. million. net sales increasedapproximately million or approximately over combined historicalnet sales. Information that adjusts for the results of the acquisitions prior tothe actual acquisition dates (the ""combined historical"" information) is providedfor informational purposes only and is to enhance comparability of the periodpresented. This information is not necessarily indicative of what the combinedresults would have been had these acquisitions occurred at the beginning of theperiods presented or the results for any future period. The increase in netsales is driven by the Outdoor Leisure group which had an increase ofapproximately million in as compared to the combined historical netsales in the same period in the prior year. This increase over combinedhistorical net sales was largely due to sales of outdoor recreation products andPowermateregistered trademark generators. The higher level of sales of theseproducts is believed to be partially attributable to heightened consumersensitivity to the need for emergency preparedness. The Company believes thatthis heightened sensitivity is reflective of a combination of factors, includingweather conditions and Year considerations. Household net sales in increased approximately million compared to combined historical netsales. The Company believes that the decrease in shipments in the prior year inorder to allow trade inventories to return to a normal level is primarilyresponsible for this increase. This factor affects the year to year comparisonsfor each of the operating groups. Adjusting for the effect on of loading,the Company believes that Household net sales in were approximately thesame as in the prior year. Within the Household segment, net sales of personalcare products increased as a result of a strengthening retail environmentlargely offset by decreases in sales of appliances. International net sales in increased . million over combined historical net sales. Highersales in Canada, Europe and Japan resulted predominantly from strong retaildemand of Powermateregistered trademark and outdoor recreation products. Thisincrease was partially offset by the impact of weak economic conditions in LatinAmerica. Gross margin for the first nine months of was . million or. million higher than the comparable period in . Adjusting for thecombined results of the acquired companies and excluding the effects of non-recurring items, which are summarized above under the heading ""Non-RecurringCharges"", gross margin for the first nine months of increased approximately million over the combined historical gross margin. As a percentage ofnet sales, gross margin improved to approximately in the first nine monthsof as compared to approximately in the period. The gross marginpercentage for the period adjusted for the non-recurring charges and forthe effect of the acquired companies was approximately of combinedhistorical net sales. The Household group contributed approximately of the gross margin improvement over the combined historical gross margin.The improvement in the Household group\'s gross margin resulted primarily fromlower sales deduction rates, improved manufacturing processes and controls,additional sales volume, and improved product mix. The Outdoor Leisure groupcontributed approximately of the gross margin improvement over the combined historical gross margin. Approximately of the improvement in theOutdoor Leisure group\'s gross margin resulted from additional volume and relatedimproved manufacturing overhead absorption, as well as improvements inmanufacturing. The balance of the increase resulted from improved product mix.The International group contributed approximately of the gross marginimprovement over combined historical gross margin. Approximately of theimprovement in the International group\'s gross margin resulted from the shutdown of the Mexico City manufacturing facility which had experienced highmaterial usage costs and employee benefit costs in the prior year. The remainingimprovement resulted from increased sales volume, a lower level of productreturns and improved product mix. SG&A expense for the first nine months of was . million, anincrease of . million or . over the same period in the prior year. Afteradjusting SG&A expense to include the acquired companies\' SG&A expense forthe period from the beginning of through the respective dates ofacquisition (. million), combined historical - -<PAGE>SG&A expense was . million. Since the combined historical SG&Aexpenses were derived by adding the acquired companies\' pre-acquisition periodcosts to the reported nine months\' results of Sunbeam, the combined historicalSG&A expenses include . million of amortization of intangibles expenserepresenting both pre- and post-acquisition periods, as well as approximately million of transaction costs incurred by the acquired companies relating tothem being purchased by Sunbeam. Excluding these costs and the effects of non-recurring charges, as described above under ""Non-Recurring Charges"",adjusted SG&A expenses were approximately million. Excludingamortization of intangibles expense of . million for the first nine monthsof and the non-recurring charges, as described above under ""Non-RecurringCharges"", adjusted SG&A costs were . million, an increase ofapproximately million over adjusted SG&A expense. As previouslydiscussed, this increase is primarily attributable to higher levels of sellingand administrative costs driven by increased net sales, headcount increases tosupport future growth and costs associated with certain redundant operationsresulting from the Company\'s acquisitions which operations the Company isintegrating and the decision to bring in-house certain functions that hadpreviously been outsourced. The Company is in the process of fully integratingcertain of these functions and expects that when this process has been completedconsolidated SG&A expense for these functions will be reduced. Partiallyoffsetting these increases in SG&A expense are certain expenses which didnot reoccur in . These expenses include increases associated withrestructuring reserve at Coleman (approximately million) and higher bad debtexpense (approximately million). Operating results for the first nine months of and , were aprofit of . million in and a loss of . million in . Adjustedfor the historical results of the acquired companies and excluding non-recurringcharges, as previously described, operating results for the and periods were a profit of . million and a loss of . million,respectively. This change resulted from the factors discussed above. Interest expense increased from . million in to . millionin . Approximately of the change related to higher borrowing levels in resulting primarily from borrowings for the acquisitions that wereoutstanding for the entire nine month period as compared to only a portionof the period. The balance of this increase was primarily driven by theamortization of the loan commitment fee (approximately million) the Companyis obligated to pay under the terms of the New Credit Facility and the expenserelated to liquidated damages payable to debenture holders (approximately million). Other income, net of . million in included a gain ofapproximately million relating to the sale of the Mexico City facility. Thisgain was partially offset by losses from other miscellaneous asset sales ofapproximately . million. The remaining other income, net in resultedfrom favorable foreign exchange rates, primarily from the Company\'s operationsin Japan. Other income, net of . million in included . million fromthe settlement of a lawsuit partially offset by net foreign exchange losses,primarily from Mexico. The minority interest reported in and relates to the minorityinterest held in Coleman by public shareholders. Approximately million of the . million income tax expenserecorded in related to U.S. tax liability generated by Coleman as aseparate U.S. tax filing entity. As previously discussed, in July , theCompany acquired a sufficient ownership interest in Coleman to permit it to fileconsolidated U.S. tax returns with Coleman for all future periods. The remainingtax expense recorded in related to taxes on foreign income and waspartially offset by the favorable resolution of an income tax audit. Tax expenserecorded in was nearly all related to foreign taxes. No net tax benefit wasrecorded on the Company\'s losses in either year as it is management\'s assessmentthat the Company cannot demonstrate that it is more likely than not thatdeferred tax assets resulting from these losses would be realized through futuretaxable income. In March , the Company prepaid a . million . industrialrevenue bond related to its Hattiesburg facility originally due in . Inconnection with the early extinguishment of this debt, the Company recognized anextraordinary charge in the first quarter of . As a result of repayment ofcertain indebtedness assumed in the Coleman acquisition, the Company alsorecognized an extraordinary charge in the second quarter of . The debtassumed in connection with the Coleman acquisition was repaid as a result of therequirements under the terms of the New Credit Facility. These extraordinarycharges consisted of redemption premiums (. million), unamortized debtdiscount (. million) and unamortized deferred financing costs (. million)and were net of income taxes (. million). - -<PAGE>FOREIGN OPERATIONS Approximately of the Company\'s business is conducted in U.S.dollars (including both domestic sales, U.S. dollar denominated export sales,primarily to certain Latin American markets, Asian sales and the majority ofEuropean sales). The Company\'s non-U.S. dollar denominated sales are madeprincipally by subsidiaries in Europe, Canada, Japan, Latin America and Mexico.Mexico reverted to a hyperinflationary status for accounting purposes in ;therefore, translation adjustments related to Mexican net monetary assets wereincluded as a component of net (loss) earnings. Mexico is not consideredhyperinflationary as of January , . This change in Mexico\'shyperinflationary status is not expected to have a material effect on theCompany\'s financial results. Translation adjustments resulting from theCompany\'s non-U.S. dollar denominated subsidiaries have not had a materialimpact on the Company\'s financial condition, results of operations, or cashflows. While revenues generated in Asia have traditionally not beensignificant, economic instability in this region is expected to have a negativeeffect on earnings. Economic instability and the political environment in LatinAmerica have also affected sales in that region. It is anticipated that sales inand exports to these regions will continue to be impacted so long as theeconomic environments in those regions remain unsettled. On a limited basis, the Company selectively uses derivatives (foreignexchange option and forward contracts) to manage foreign exchange exposures thatarise in the normal course of business. No derivative contracts are entered intofor trading or speculative purposes. The use of derivatives has not had amaterial impact on the Company\'s financial results.SEASONALITY Sunbeam\'s consolidated sales are not expected to exhibit substantialseasonality; however, sales are expected to be strongest during the secondquarter of the calendar year. Furthermore, sales of a number of products,including warming blankets, vaporizers, humidifiers, grills, First Alertproducts, camping and generator products may be impacted by unseasonable weatherconditions.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESDEBT INSTRUMENTS In order to finance the acquisition of Coleman, First Alert andSignature Brands and to refinance substantially all of the indebtedness of theCompany and the three acquired companies, the Company consummated an offering inMarch of zero coupon debentures having a yield to maturity of , whichresulted in approximately million of net proceeds and borrowed about ,million under its new bank credit facility. The debentures are exchangeable for shares of the Company \'s commonstock at an initial conversion rate of . shares for each , principalamount at maturity of the debentures, subject to adjustments upon occurrence ofspecified events. The debentures are subordinated in right of payment to allexisting and future senior indebtedness of the Company. The debentures are notredeemable by the Company prior to March , . On or after such date, thedebentures are redeemable for cash with at least days notice, at the optionof the Company. The Company is required to purchase debentures at the option ofthe holder as of March , , March , and March , , at purchaseprices equal to the issue price plus accrued original discount to such dates.Sunbeam may, at its option, elect to pay any such purchase price in cash orcommon stock or any combination thereof. However, the bank credit facilityprohibits the Company from redeeming or repurchasing debentures for cash. TheCompany was required to file a registration statement with the SEC to registerthe debentures by June , . This registration statement was filed onFebruary , and, as amended, was declared effective on November , .The Company \'s failure to file the registration statement by June , didnot constitute default under the terms of the debentures. From June , until the registration statement was declared effective, the Company wasrequired to pay to the debenture holders cash liquidated damages accruing, foreach day during such period, at a rate per annum equal to . during the first days and . thereafter multiplied by the total of the issue price of thedebentures plus the original issue discount thereon on such day. The Company hasmade total payments for liquidated damages since June , of . million,of which . million related to damages for the period through December ,. A final payment of approximately . million, representing liquidateddamages from September , until the registration statement was declaredeffective, will be payable on March , . - -<PAGE> Concurrent with the acquisitions, the Company replaced its millionsyndicated unsecured five-year revolving credit facility with the bank creditfacility. The bank credit facility provided for aggregate borrowings of up to. billion and in addition to other customary covenants, required the Companyto maintain specified consolidated leverage, interest coverage and fixed chargecoverage ratios as of the end of each fiscal quarter occurring after March , and on or prior to the latest stated maturity date for any of theborrowings under the bank credit facility. As a result of, among other things, its operating losses incurredduring the first half of , the Company did not achieve the specifiedfinancial ratios for June , and it appeared unlikely that the Companywould achieve the specified financial ratios for September , .Consequently, the Company and its lenders entered into an agreement dated as ofJune , that waived through December , all defaults arising fromthe failure of the Company to satisfy the specified financial ratios for June, and September , . Pursuant to an agreement with the Company datedas of October , , the Company \'s lenders extended all of the waivers underthe June agreement through April , and also waived through such dateall defaults arising from any failure by the Company to satisfy the specifiedfinancial ratios for December , . As part of the October , agreement, the Company agreed to a minimum monthly earnings before interest,taxes, depreciation and amortization (""EBITDA"") covenant (as defined in the bankcredit facility) which covenant the Company has been able to satisfy. On April , , among other things, the lenders extended all of thewaivers set forth in the October , agreement through April , . OnApril , , the Company and its lenders entered into a comprehensiveamendment to the bank credit facility that, among other things, extended all ofthe waivers under the April , agreement until April , and waiveduntil such date all defaults arising from any failure by the Company to satisfythe specified financial ratios for any fiscal quarter end occurring during and for March , . As part of the April , bank credit facility amendment, theCompany agreed to a minimum cumulative EBITDA covenant that is based onpost-December , consolidated EBITDA and is tested at the end of eachmonth occurring on or prior to March , , as well as a covenant limitingthe amount of revolving loans (other than those used to fund the Coleman merger)that may be outstanding under the bank credit facility as of the end of eachsuch month. The minimum cumulative EBITDA was initially . million for theperiod January , through April , and generally grows on a monthlybasis until it reaches . million for the period from January , through March , . Following is a description of the significant terms ofthe bank credit facility as amended April , .The bank credit facility provides for aggregate borrowings of up to . billionthrough: o a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to . million maturing March , , . million of which may only be used to complete the Coleman merger; o up to . million in term loans maturing on March , , of which . million may only be used to complete the Coleman merger; and o a . million term loan maturing September , , of which . million has already been repaid through September , . As of September , , approximately . billion was outstandingand approximately . billion was available for borrowing under the bank creditfacility.Under the bank credit facility, interest accrues, at the Company \'s option: o at the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR""); o or at the base rate of the administrative agent which is generally the higher of the prime commercial lending rate of the administrative agent or the Federal Funds Rate plus .;in each case plus an interest margin which is currently . for LIBORborrowings and . for base rate borrowings. The applicable interest margin issubject to downward adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events includinga . decrease for LIBOR borrowings and a . decrease for base rateborrowings concurrent with the effective date of the Coleman merger. - -<PAGE> Under the terms of the April , amendment to the bank creditfacility, the Company is obligated to pay the bank lenders a loan commitment feeof between . to . of the commitments under the bank credit facility asof April , . The percentage used to calculate the fee will be determinedby reference to the bank lenders\' aggregate commitments and loan exposure underthe bank credit facility as they may be reduced on or before September , .The fee is payable on the earlier of September , and the date thecommitments are terminated and the loans and other amount payable under the bankcredit facility are repaid. (See Note to the Condensed Consolidated FinancialStatements.) Borrowings under the bank credit facility are secured by a pledge ofthe stock of the Company\'s material subsidiaries, including Coleman, and by asecurity interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company and itsmaterial domestic subsidiaries, other than Coleman and its material subsidiariesexcept as described below. Currently, Coleman\'s inventory and related assets arepledged to secure its obligations for letters of credit issued for its accountunder the bank credit facility. Additionally, as security for Coleman\'s notepayable to the Company, Coleman pledged substantially all of its domesticassets, other than real property, including of the stock of its directforeign subsidiaries and domestic holding companies for its foreign subsidiariesand all of the stock of its other direct domestic subsidiaries but not theassets of Coleman\'s subsidiaries. The pledge runs in favor of the Company \'slending banks, to which the Coleman note has been pledged as security for theCompany \'s obligations to them. Upon completion of the Coleman merger,substantially all of Coleman\'s assets and the assets of Coleman\'s domesticsubsidiaries will be pledged to secure the obligations under the bank creditfacility. In addition, borrowings under the bank credit facility are guaranteedby a number of the Company \'s wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries andthese subsidiary guarantees are secured as described above. Upon completion ofthe Coleman merger, Coleman and each of its United States subsidiaries willbecome guarantors of the obligations under the bank credit facility. To theextent extensions of credit are made to any subsidiaries of the Company, theobligations of such subsidiaries are guaranteed by the Company. In addition to the above described financial ratios and tests, the bankcredit facility contains covenants customary for credit facilities of a similarnature, including limitations on the ability of the Company and itssubsidiaries, including Coleman, to, among other things: o declare dividends or repurchase stock; o prepay, redeem or repurchase debt, incur liens and engage in sale-leaseback transactions; o make loans and investments; o incur additional debt (including revolving loans under the bank credit facility); o amend or otherwise alter material agreements or enter into restrictive agreements; o make capital and Year compliance expenditures; o engage in mergers, acquisitions and asset sales; o engage in transactions with specified affiliates; o settle specified litigation; o alter its cash management system; and o alter the businesses they conduct.Sunbeam is also required to comply with specified financial covenants andratios. The bank credit facility provides for events of default customary fortransactions of this type, including nonpayment, misrepresentation, breach ofcovenant, cross-defaults, bankruptcy, material adverse change arising fromcompliance with ERISA, material adverse judgments, entering into guarantees andchange of ownership and control. It is also an event of default under the bankcredit facility, as amended November , , if the Company \'s registrationstatement in connection with the Coleman merger is not declared effective by theSEC on or before January , , or if the merger does not occur within business days of the effectiveness of the registration statement or if the cashconsideration--including any payments on account of the exercise of anyappraisal rights, but excluding related legal, accounting and other customaryfees and expenses--to consummate the Coleman merger exceeds . million.Although there can be no assurance, the Company anticipates that it will satisfythese conditions. Furthermore, the bank credit facility requires the Company toprepay term loans under the bank credit facility on December , to theextent that cash on hand in the Company \'s concentration accounts plus theaggregate amount of unused revolving loan commitments - -<PAGE>on this date exceeds million, but the Company is not required to prepaymore than . million in the aggregate as a result of this provision. Unless waived by the bank lenders, the failure of the Company tosatisfy any of the financial ratios and tests contained in the bank creditfacility or the occurrence of any other event of default under the bank creditfacility would entitle the bank lenders to (a) receive a . increase in theinterest rate applicable to outstanding loans and increase the trade letter ofcredit fees to . and (b) accelerate the maturity of the outstandingborrowings under the bank credit facility and exercise all or any of their otherrights and remedies. Any such acceleration or other exercise of rights andremedies would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company. The bank credit facility also includes provisions for the deferral ofthe September , and the March , scheduled term loan payments of. million each until April , as a result of the satisfaction by theCompany of the agreed upon conditions to the deferral. (See Note to theCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements.)CASH FLOWS As of September , , the Company had cash and cash equivalents of. million and total debt of . billion. Because the waivers granted by theCompany\'s lenders expire on April , , the borrowings under the bank creditfacility, as well as other debt containing cross-default provisions, areclassified as current in the September , Condensed Consolidated BalanceSheet. Cash used in operating activities during the first nine months of was . million compared to . million in the first nine months of .This change is primarily attributable to improved operating results after givingeffect to non-cash items, partially offset by increased working capital needsduring the period. The increase in cash used for working capital during the period was primarily driven by accounts receivable, which increased .million as compared to the period, primarily attributable to the Company\'sOutdoor Leisure division which experienced stronger second and third quarterssales in than in . Additionally, working capital for the periodwas positively affected by the timing of the Company\'s acquisition of Coleman,which was at the peak of its inventory build for the selling season. Cashused for this acquired inventory is not reflected in working capital for the period. As a result of the effect of Company\'s management of inventorylevels in , cash flow improved approximately million as compared to despite the favorable impact of the inventory acquired in connection with the acquisitions. Increases in accounts payable of approximately million inthe first nine months of positively impacted cash flow whereas payablesused approximately million of cash in the same period of , resulting inan improvement in cash flow period-to-period of approximately million. Theincrease in payables in the current period resulted from payable balances havingbeen reduced to a low level by year-end . This reduction in payables, whichincluded an effort to reduce delinquent payables, began in the second quarter of. Decreases in other liabilities, primarily accrued interest, account forthe majority of the balance of the cash used for working capital in . TheCompany participates in an accounts receivable securitization program to financea portion of its accounts receivable. See Note to the Condensed ConsolidatedFinancial Statements. In the first nine months of , cash used in investing activities wasdriven by capital expenditures of . million, primarily for informationsystems, including expenditures for Year readiness and equipment andtooling for new products. Capital spending in the comparable period was. million and was primarily for several manufacturing efficiencyinitiatives, equipment and tooling for new products and management informationsystems and software licenses. The new product capital spending in the period principally related to the appliance category and included costs relatedto water and air filtration products which were discontinued in the secondquarter, blenders, standmixers and irons. Cash used in investing activities inthe first nine months of also reflects . million for the acquisitionsof the shares of Coleman from a subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes, as well asthe acquisitions of Signature Brands and First Alert. The Company anticipates capital spending to be less than of net sales. Capital expenditures inthe current year are expected to primarily relate to information systems andrelated support, including expenditures for Year readiness, new productintroductions and capacity additions. Cash provided by financing activities totaled . million in thefirst nine months of and reflected net borrowings under the Company\'s bankcredit facility. Cash provided by financing activities in the first nine monthsof was . million and reflected net proceeds from the debentures of. million, the cancellation and repayment of all outstanding balances underthe Company\'s million September revolving credit facility, therepayment of certain debt assumed in connection with the Coleman, SignatureBrands and First Alert acquisitions, and the early extinguishment of the .million Hattiesburg industrial revenue bond. In addition, cash provided byfinancing - -<PAGE>activities in is net of . million of financing fees related toSunbeam\'s . billion bank credit facility and . million of proceeds fromthe exercise of stock options. See Note to the Condensed ConsolidatedFinancial Statements. At September , , standby and commercial letters of creditaggregated . million and were predominately for insurance, pension,environmental, workers\' compensation, and international trade activities. Inaddition, as of September , , surety bonds with a contract value of .million were outstanding largely for the Company\'s pension plans and as a resultof litigation judgments that are currently under appeal. The Company expects to acquire the remaining equity interest in Colemanin a merger transaction in which the existing Coleman minority shareholders willreceive . of a share of the Company\'s common stock and . in cash foreach share of Coleman common stock outstanding. In addition, unexercised optionsunder Coleman\'s stock option plans will be cashed out at a price per share equalto the difference between . and the exercise price of such options. TheCompany expects to issue approximately . million shares of common stock andexpend approximately million in cash, including cash paid to option holders,to complete the Coleman transaction. Under a settlement of certain litigationrelating to the Coleman merger, the Company will also issue warrants to purchaseup to . million shares of the Company\'s common stock to the Coleman publicshareholders and the plaintiff\'s litigation counsel upon consummation of theColeman merger. (See Notes and to the Condensed Consolidated FinancialStatements.) Although there can be no assurance, it is anticipated that theColeman merger will occur in the fourth quarter of or early in the firstquarter of . The Company believes its borrowing capacity under the bank creditfacility, cash flow from the combined operations of the Company and its acquiredcompanies, existing cash and cash equivalent balances, and its receivablesecuritization program will be sufficient to support working capital needs,capital expenditure and Year compliance spending, and debt service throughApril , . The Company intends to negotiate with its lenders on anamendment to the bank credit facility, negotiate with its lenders on furtherwaiver of such covenants and other terms or refinance the bank credit facility.Any decisions with respect to such amendment, waiver, or refinancing will bemade based on a review from time to time of the advisability of particulartransactions. There can be no assurance that an amendment, further waiver ofexisting covenants and other terms, or refinancing will be entered into by April, . The failure to obtain such an amendment, further waiver or debtrefinancing would likely result in violation of existing covenants andnon-compliance with other terms, which would permit the bank lenders toaccelerate the maturity of all outstanding borrowings under the bank creditfacility, which would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company.Accordingly, debt related to the bank credit facility and all debt containingcross-default provisions is classified as current in the September , Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. In May, , the NYSE advised the Company that it did not meet thecontinuing listing standards of the NYSE because the Company did not havetangible net assets of at least million and average annual net income of atleast , for , and . Representatives from the Company metwith NYSE officials, and in March , the NYSE informed the Company that theCompany\'s common stock would not be delisted at that time, although the NYSEwould, however, continue to monitor Sunbeam\'s financial condition andoperations. On August , , the NYSE advised the Company that the NYSE hadrevised its continuing listing standards, and that the Company is in compliancewith the revised standards. In April, the NYSE advised Coleman that it did not meet the NYSE\'scontinuing listing standards because Coleman did not have tangible net assets ofat least million and average annual net income of at least , for, and . At that time, Coleman requested the NYSE to continue tolist the Coleman common stock until completion of the merger. The NYSEsubsequently advised Coleman that Coleman also failed to satisfy certainnon-financial continuing listing standards. On August , , the NYSE advisedthe Company that the NYSE had revised its continuing listing standards, and thatthe Company is in compliance with the revised financial standards. Coleman andthe NYSE have agreed upon a program whereby Coleman will correct thedeficiencies in its non-financial continuing listing standards by the end of. Coleman is currently complying with such program. If Coleman were to bedelisted from the NYSE, it would adversely affect Coleman\'s ability to sell itscapital stock to third parties or use its capital stock as collateral for loans.Sunbeam\'s bank credit facility currently restricts Coleman from taking suchactions. By letter dated June , , the staff of the Division of Enforcementof the SEC advised the Company that it was conducting an informal inquiry intothe Company \'s accounting policies and procedures and requested that the Companyproduce documents. On July , , the SEC issued a Formal Order of PrivateInvestigation, designating officers to take testimony and pursuant to which asubpoena was served on Sunbeam requiring the production of - -<PAGE>documents. On November , , the Company received another SEC subpoenarequiring the production of additional documents. The Company has providednumerous documents to the SEC staff and continues to cooperate with the SECstaff. The Company has, however, declined to provide the SEC with material thatthe Company believes is subject to the attorney-client privilege and the workproduct immunity. The Company cannot predict the duration of such investigationor its outcome. The Company is involved in significant litigation, including class andderivative actions, relating to events which led to the restatement of itsconsolidated financial statements, the issuance of the MacAndrews & Forbeswarrant, the sale of the debentures and the employment agreements of Messrs.Dunlap and Kersh. Sunbeam intends to vigorously defend each of the actions, butcannot predict the outcome and is not currently able to evaluate the likelihoodof the Company \'s success in each case or the range of potential loss. However,if the Company were to lose these suits, judgments would likely have a materialadverse effect on the Company \'s financial position, results of operations andcash flows. Additionally, the Company\'s insurance carriers have filed varioussuits requesting a declaratory judgment that the directors\' and officers\'liability insurance policies for excess coverage was invalid andor had beenproperly canceled by the carriers or have advised Sunbeam of their intent todeny coverage under such policies. The Company intends to pursue recovery fromall of its insurers if damages are awarded against the Company or itsindemnified officers andor directors under any of the foregoing actions and torecover attorneys\' fees covered under those policies. The Company \'s failure toobtain such insurance recoveries following an adverse judgment against theCompany on any of the foregoing actions could have a material adverse effect onthe Company \'s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Amounts accrued for litigation matters represent the anticipated costs(damages andor settlement amounts) in connection with pending litigation andclaims and related anticipated legal fees. The costs are accrued when it is bothprobable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred andthe amount can be reasonably estimated. The accruals are based upon the Company\'s assessment, after consultation with counsel, of probable loss based on thefacts and circumstances of each case, the legal issues involved, the nature ofthe claim made, the nature of the damages sought and any relevant informationabout the plaintiff, and other significant factors which vary by case. When itis not possible to estimate a specific expected amount of loss to be incurred,the Company evaluates the range of possible losses and records the minimum endof the range. As of September , the Company had established accruals forlitigation matters of . million (representing . million and .million for estimated damages or settlement amounts and legal fees,respectively) and . million as of December , (representing .million and . million for estimated damages or settlements and legal fees,respectively.) It is anticipated that the . million accrual will be paid asfollows: . million in , . million in and . million in .The Company believes, based on information known to the Company on September ,, that anticipated probable costs of litigation matters existing as ofSeptember , have been adequately reserved, to the extent determinable. As a consumer goods manufacturer and distributor, the Company faces theconstant risks of product liability and related lawsuits involving claims forsubstantial money damages, product recall actions and higher than anticipatedrates of warranty returns or other returns of goods. These claims could resultin liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\'sfinancial position, results of operations and cash flows. Some of the productlines the Company acquired in the acquisitions have increased its exposureto product liability and related claims. The Company and its subsidiaries are also involved in various lawsuitsfrom time to time that Sunbeam considers to be ordinary routine litigationincidental to its business. In the opinion of the Company, the resolution ofthese routine matters, and of matters relating to prior operations, individuallyor in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the financialposition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. See Note to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Effective January , , the Company adopted Statement of Position-, ACCOUNTING FOR THE COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPED OR OBTAINED FORINTERNAL USE (""SOP -""). SOP - requires computer software costs associatedwith internal use software to be expensed as incurred until certaincapitalization criteria are met.

The Company has not yet determinedthe impact SFAS No. will have on its consolidated financial position,results of operations, or cash flows.YEAR READINESS DISCLOSURE The Company is preparing for the impact of the Year on itsoperations. Year issues could include potential problems in the informationtechnology (""IT"") and non-IT systems that the Company uses in its operations andproblems in the Company\'s products. Year system failures could affectroutine but critical operations such as forecasting, purchasing, production,order processing, inventory control, shipping, billing and collection. Inaddition, system failures could affect the Company\'s security, payrolloperations, or employee safety. The Company may also be exposed to potentialrisks from third parties with whom the Company interacts who fail to adequatelyaddress their own Year issues.SUNBEAM\'S APPROACH TO YEAR ISSUES While the Company\'s Year readiness planning had been underway forover one year, during the third quarter of the Company established across-functional project team consisting of senior managers, assisted by threeexternal consulting firms which were retained to provide consulting services andto assist the Company in implementing its Year strategy. This team issponsored by the Company\'s Chief Financial Officer who reports directly to theCompany\'s Chief Executive Officer on this issue. The audit committee of theboard of directors is advised periodically on the status of the Company\'s Year readiness program. The Year project team has developed a phased approach to identifyand resolve Year issues with many of these activities conducted inparallel. The Company\'s approach and the anticipated timing of each phase aredescribed below. PHASE - INVENTORY AND ASSESSMENT: During the first phase of Sunbeam\'sYear readiness program, the Company established a Year programmanagement office (""PMO"") to centralize the management of all of the Company\'sYear projects. Through this office, the Company developed a corporate-wide,uniform strategy for assessing and addressing the Year issues. The Company has completed an inventory of its hardware and softwaresystems, manufacturing equipment, electronic data interchange,telecommunications and other technical assets potentially subject to Year problems, such as security systems and controls for lighting, air conditioning,ventilation and facility access. This inventory was then entered into theCompany\'s Year database along with a determination of the item\'s level ofcriticality to operations. For those inventory items anticipated to have asignificant effect on the business if not corrected, the Company\'s Year program envisions repair or replacement and testing of such items. Allinformation relative to each item is being tracked in the Company\'s Year database. The Company completed most of this phase during the third and fourthquarters of . The Company has completed a review of the readiness ofembedded microprocessors in its products and determined that none of theCompany\'s products have Year date sensitive systems. PHASE - CORRECTION AND TESTING: The second phase of Sunbeam\'s Year readiness program was structured to replace, upgrade or remediate (asnecessary) those items identified during Phase as requiring corrective action. Sunbeam relies on its IT functions to perform many tasks that arecritical to its operations. Significant transactions that could be impacted bynot being ready for any Year issues include, among others, purchases ofmaterials, production management, order entry and fulfillment, payrollprocessing and billings and collections. Systems and applications that had beenidentified by Sunbeam as not Year ready and which are critical to Sunbeam\'soperations include its financial software systems, which process the orderentry, purchasing, production management, general ledger, accounts receivable,and accounts payable functions, payroll applications, and critical applicationsin the Company\'s manufacturing and distribution facilities, such as warehousemanagement applications. Recognizing how dependent the entire company is on IT,Sunbeam decided in to replace its primary business applications with auniform international business and accounting information system to address thesystems or applications listed above as well as to improve internal reportingprocesses. Based upon representations from the manufacturer that the current - -<PAGE>version of this uniform information system is Year ready, the Companyupgraded its business sites that currently utilize this uniform system to theYear ready version. In addition to the pre-acquisition Sunbeam locationswhich had already utilized an earlier non-Year ready version of thisuniform business and accounting information system, Eastpak, Mr. Coffee,Health-o-Meter and Sunbeam Latin America replaced their non-Year readysystems with this new uniform system. In addition, Coleman Europe has alsoreplaced key business components with this new system. The Company is also actively replacing andor upgrading a number ofbusiness systems that are not Year ready, including those that uselocalized business system packages which were not candidates to be replaced bythe uniform business and accounting information system. For example, at Colemanapproximately , mainframe software programs that are used in lieu ofSunbeam\'s uniform business and accounting information system have beenremediated and tested to be Year ready. With respect to the Company\'snon-IT systems (for example, time and attendance, security, and in-linemanufacturing hardware) the Company has analyzed these items to assess any Year issues and is testing and correcting such times, if necessary. PHASE - CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS: The third phaseof Sunbeam\'s Year readiness program which was initiated during the thirdand fourth quarters of is designed to assess and interact with theCompany\'s customers, suppliers, and business partners. As part of this effort,the Company surveyed , vendors and suppliers, a portion of which did notprovide an initial response. During the first half of , ""high risk"" vendorswere contacted directly and the number of non-respondents has since decreasedsubstantially. In fact, currently only of the Company\'s vendors who weresurveyed are categorized as ""high risk"" which includes non-respondents. Based onthe most recent responses to the survey and continued evaluation, the Companybelieves that there is only a low to a medium risk of Year issues for theremaining vendors. The Company will continue to monitor the Year progressof the ""high risk"" vendors and has re-surveyed these companies to determine theappropriate course of action. Furthermore, the Company has contacted alternatevendors who are Year ready to replace critical vendors deemed ""high risk""in the event that these vendors are not found to be Year ready. The Companyis in the process of completing a verification of the Year survey responsesfor the most critical vendors to the Company. Sunbeam has responded to numerous customer inquiries about theCompany\'s Year readiness. The Company has verified that all of theCompany\'s major customers have planned programs to deal with Year issuesand is currently completing the process of contacting its major customers toconfirm they are implementing their planned programs to address Year issues. In order to improve the Company\'s communication with its customers,suppliers and business partners, the Company has set up a Sunbeam Year telephone number and is providing Year information on a Company web site. PHASE - CONTINGENCY PLANNING: This phase involves contingencyplanning for unresolved Year issues, particularly any issues arising withthird party suppliers. The Company has designed and documented its Year contingency plan and is in the process of implementing it. The development ofthe contingency plan included a process whereby the Company\'s critical IT andnon-IT systems were evaluated for Year readiness. As a result of thisevaluation, the Company does not expect to require additional operationalequipment or significant process contingency measures. Although the Company doesnot currently believe there is significant risk associated with its third partysuppliers, the contingency plan includes the continuing evaluation of thereadiness of the Company\'s suppliers and minor increases in the Company\'sinventory requirements to protect against supply disruption.THE RISKS OF SUNBEAM\'S YEAR APPROACH The independent consultants assisting the Company in its Year readiness program have reviewed and concurred with the Company\'s approach, haveassisted in developing cost estimates and have monitored costs for the largestsingle component (upgrade or installation of the Company\'s uniform system) ofthe Company\'s Year program. Since Sunbeam\'s Year program was developedand is monitored with the help of independent consultants, the Company did notengage another independent third party to verify the program\'s overall approachor total cost as the Company believes that the Company\'s exposure in this regardis mitigated. In addition, through the use of external third-party diagnosticsoftware packages that are designed to analyze the Year readiness ofbusiness software programs, the Company was able to identify potential Year issues at Coleman. Given this, the Company believes that it has also mitigatedits risk by validating and verifying key program components. Management believes that, although there are significant systems thatare being modified or replaced, including the uniform business and accountinginformation system, Sunbeam\'s information systems environment will be made Year - -<PAGE> ready prior to January , . Sunbeam\'s failure to timely complete suchcorrective work could have a material adverse impact on the Company. With respect to customers, suppliers and business partners, the failureof certain of these third parties to become Year ready could also have amaterial adverse impact on Sunbeam. For example, the failure of certain of theCompany\'s principal suppliers to have Year ready internal systems couldimpact the Company\'s ability to manufacture andor ship its products or tomaintain adequate inventory levels for production. At this time, the Company believes that the most likely ""worst-case""scenario relating to Year involves potential disruptions in areas in whichthe Company\'s operations must rely on third parties, such as suppliers, whosesystems may not work properly after January , . While such system failurescould either directly or indirectly affect important operations of the Companyand its subsidiaries in a significant manner, the Company cannot at presentestimate either the likelihood or the potential cost of such failures. Subjectto the nature of the goods or services provided to the Company by third partieswhose operations are not made ready for Year issues, the potential impacton Sunbeam\'s operations could be material. However, the Company believes that ithas mitigated such risks through the development and implementation of thecontingency plans discussed above. The nature and focus of the Company\'s efforts to address the Year problem may be revised periodically as interim goals are achieved or new issuesare identified. In addition, it is important to note that the description of theCompany\'s efforts and assessments necessarily involves estimates and projectionswith respect to activities required in the future. These estimates andprojections are subject to change as work continues, and such changes may besubstantial.THE COSTS TO ADDRESS THE COMPANY\'S YEAR ISSUES Through the first nine months of , including costs incurred in, Sunbeam had expended approximately million to address Year issuesof which approximately was recorded as capital expenditures and theremainder as SG&A expense. Sunbeam\'s current assessment of the total costs toaddress and remedy Year issues and enhance its operating systems, includingcosts for the acquired companies, is approximately million. This estimateincludes the following categories:o uniform international business and accounting systems milliono localized business system software upgrades and remediation milliono Year readiness assessment and tracking milliono upgrade of personal computers and related software million The amount to be incurred for Year issues during ofapproximately million represents over of the Company\'s total budgetfor information systems and related support, including Year costs. A largemajority of these costs are expected to be incremental expenditures that willnot recur in the Year or thereafter. Fees and expenses related to thirdparty consultants, who are involved in the PMO as well as the modification andreplacement of software, represent approximately of the total estimatedcost. The balance of the total estimated cost relates primarily to softwarelicense fees and new hardware, but excludes the costs associated with Companyemployees. Sunbeam expects these expenditures to be financed through operatingcash flows or borrowings, as applicable. A significant portion of theseexpenditures will enhance Sunbeam\'s operating systems in addition to resolvingthe Year issues. As Sunbeam completes its assessment of the Year issues, the actual expenditures incurred or to be incurred may differ materiallyfrom the amounts shown above. The bank credit facility does not permit theCompany to spend more than million on Year testing and remediation in. Because Year readiness is critical to the business, Sunbeam hasredeployed some resources from non-critical system enhancements to address Year issues, thereby deferring the non-critical systems enhancements. TheCompany does not expect these redeployments and deferrals to have a materialimpact on the Company\'s financial condition, results of operations, or cashflows. - -<PAGE>CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form -Q may constitute""forward-looking"" statements within the meaning of the Private SecuritiesLitigation Reform Act of , as the same may be amended from time to time(herein the ""Act"") and in releases made by the SEC from time to time.

Total rentalrevenue increased by . million to . million for the sixmonths ended September , . Net revenues from the rental ofmoving related equipment increased by . million. This increase isprimarily attributable to higher truck rental revenues. The growth intruck rental revenue primarily reflects improved utilization and anincrease in the average revenue per transaction. Net sales revenues were . million and . million for thesix months ended September , and , respectively. Revenuegrowth from the sale of moving support items (i.e. boxes, etc.), whichwas up by . during the six months ended September , , led tothe improvement. Cost of sales was . million for the six months endedSeptember , , which represents a marginal decrease from .million for the same period of the prior year. Operating expenses before intercompany eliminations increased to. million for the six months ended September , from .million for the six months ended September , . Increasedexpenditure levels for rental equipment maintenance and personnel dueto an increase in fleet size and inventory levels were primarilyresponsible. Lease expense was . million and . million for the sixmonths ended September , and , respectively. This increasereflects additional leasing activity over the past twelve months. Net depreciation expense for the six months ended September , was . million, as compared to . million in the sameperiod of the prior year. The increase reflects an increase indepreciation recognized on the rental truck fleet.<PAGE> Real Estate Operations Rental revenue before intercompany eliminations was . millionfor the six months ended September , , compared to . millionfor the six months ended September , . Intercompany revenue was. million and . million for the six months ended September , and , respectively. Net investment and interest income was . million for the sixmonths ended September , as compared to . million during thesame period of the prior year. This increase correlates to asignificant increase in average note and mortgage receivablesoutstanding. Operating expenses were . million for the six months endedSeptember , versus . million for the six months endedSeptember , . Reduced building maintenance expense accountedfor the majority of the decline from the prior year. Lease expense for the six months ended September , and was . million and . million, respectively. The increasereflects payments under a synthetic lease facility being utilized todevelop storage properties. Net depreciation expense for the six months ended September , was . million, as compared to . million in the same periodof the prior year. The decrease reflects higher gains from thedisposition of property and lower levels of depreciable assets.Property and Casualty Republic\'s premiums were . million and . million for thesix months ended June , and , respectively. The decreasein premium for as compared to resulted from the U-HaulLiability programs in the rental industry, which decreased to .million from . million, respectively. This decrease results fromthe restructuring of the U-Haul Business Auto General Liabilitypolicy. The deductible was changed at April , from a flatdeductible to a deductible. This reduced premiums by . millionfor the six months ended June , as compared to . Theimpact of this change will result in an overall savings of .million in premium taxes for policy year . Additionally, assumedtreaty reinsurance decreased to . million for the six months endedJune , as compared to . million for the six monthsended June , due to the Crop Hail premium accrued atDecember . Premiums for these programs are accrued during thefourth quarter and are settled in the first quarter of the followingyear. Direct multiple peril and general agency premium increased to. million and . million, respectively, for the six months endedJune , compared to . million and . million, respectively,for the six months ended June , . Net investment income was . million and . million for thesix months ended June , and , respectively. The decreasefrom to is attributable to a decrease in invested assets anda lower yield on reinvested funds. Benefits and losses were . million and . million for thesix months ended June , and , respectively. The decreasefrom to resulted from a decrease in the U-Haul Liabilityprograms for unpaid reported claims corresponding to the decrease inpremiums mentioned above. Deferred acquisition costs (DAC) consists of commissions andother costs, which vary with and are primarily related to theproduction of new business. The prior year end commissions, and otherrelated expenses, are amortized over the following year. Theamortization expenses for the six months ended June , and consisted of . million and . million, respectively. Theincrease from to is due mainly to Republic\'s subsidiarycompany\'s DAC expense, which increased to . million for the sixmonths ended June , from a negligible amount for the six monthsended June , . Also contributing was a . million increase inthe nonaffiliated agents\' expense. Field Underwriters increased dueto written and unearned premiums and Republic Western SpecialtyUnderwriters increased due to commission expenses relating to asettlement agreement with the previous general agent. Additionally, assumed treaty reinsurance increased . million due to increased premium writings.<PAGE> Operating expenses were . million and . million for thesix months ended June , and , respectively. Commissionsdecreased to . million for the six months ended June , compared to . million for the six months ended June , .This is mainly attributable to Republic\'s subsidiary\'s DAC earned forthe six months ended June , . No DAC for this subsidiary wasincluded for the six months ended June , , as the subsidiary waspurchased in December . Additionally, there was an increase inthe nonaffiliated agents\' DAC expense mentioned above. Slightlyoffsetting were increased lease expenses of . million for the sixmonths ended June , from . million for the six months endedJune , . All other underwriting expenses consisted of .million and . million for the six months ended June , and, respectively. Operating profit before tax and intercompany elimination was .million and . million for the six months ended June , and, respectively. This represents a decrease in of .million over and resulted mainly from decreased premium revenueand investment income and increased underwriting expenses. Republic\'soperating profit remains on plan to meet year end expectations.Life Insurance Net premiums were . million for the six months ended June , and . million for . Oxford realized premium increasesin the areas of Medicare supplement, credit life and disability, and singlepremium whole life insurance products. Oxford increased Medicare supplementpremium through the reinsurance of a block of policies and by adding directpremium through new programs; these increased premiums by . million.Credit life and disability premiums grew . million from increased marketingefforts. Both Oxford\'s recently acquired companies, North American InsuranceCompany (NAI) and Safe Mate Life Insurance Company (Safe Mate), heavily marketcredit life and disability insurance. Oxford began marketing a new singlepremium whole life policy in ; this product accounted for . million ofnew premiums. As expected, premiums decreased due to fewer annuitizations,the termination of non-essential NAI lines and the sale of North American Fire& Casualty Insurance Company at the end of to Republic. These changesaccounted for a . million decrease in premiums through the first six monthsof . Net investment income before intercompany eliminations was .million for the six months ended June , and . million for. This increase is due to the increase in the average investedassets for the year, which was the result of new premium in andthe increased asset base from the acquisition of NAI and Safe Mate. Benefits incurred were . million and . million forthe six months ended June , and , respectively. Thisincrease is primarily due to Medicare supplement benefits incurred.These benefits are related to the new business recorded in . Thenew Medicare supplement reinsurance accounted for . million ofbenefit variance. Oxford has experienced improved loss ratios in itscredit insurance products, partially offsetting the new Medicaresupplement benefits. Amortization of DAC was . million and . million for the sixmonths ended June , and , respectively. Typically, Oxforddefers commissions and other policy acquisition costs on singlepremium business. These costs are amortized as the premium is earnedover the term of the policy. Oxford continues to increase its singlepremium credit business in force, thus increasing both the deferredcosts on the balance sheet and the subsequent amortization. Operating expenses were . million and . million for thesix months ended June , and , respectively. A keycomponent of operating expenses is the amortization of acquisitioncosts resulting from the purchase of NAI. This amounts to .million in . Commissions have increased . million in inproportion to the increase in new premiums. Operating expenses, stillwithin budgeted expectations, have increased in due to theexpansion of business volume. Operating profit before tax and intercompany eliminations was. million and . million for the six months ended June , and , respectively. The decrease over the prior year is primarilydue to increased health loss ratios. This negative trend is beingcorrected through statutory premium rate filings.Interest Expense Interest expense was . million for the six months endedSeptember , , as compared to . million for the six monthsended September , . The increase can be attributed to anincrease in average debt outstanding and a modest increase in theaverage cost of debt.<PAGE> Consolidated Group As a result of the foregoing, pretax earnings of . millionwere realized in the six months ended September , , as comparedto . million for the same period in . After providing forincome taxes, net earnings for the six months ended September , were . million, as compared to . million for the same periodof the prior year.QUARTERLY RESULTS The following table presents unaudited quarterly results for theten quarters in the period beginning April , and endingSeptember , . AMERCO believes that all necessary adjustmentshave been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly, andin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, its results.U-Haul moving and storage operations are seasonal and proportionally more ofAMERCO\'s revenues and net earnings from its U-Haul moving and storageoperations are generated in the first and second quarters of eachfiscal year (April through September).

In the six months ended September , ,capital expenditures were . million, as compared to .million in the six months ended September , . Theseexpenditures primarily reflect the expansion of the rental truckfleet. The capital required to fund these acquisitions was obtainedthrough internally generated funds from operations and through leasefinancings.

The primary usesof cash are operating costs and benefit payments to policyholders.Matching the investment portfolio to the cash flow demands of thetypes of insurance being written is an important consideration.Benefit and claim statistics are continually monitored to provideprojections of future cash requirements. Cash flows provided by operating activities were . million forthe six months ended June , and . Cash flows provided byfinancing activities were approximately . million and . millionfor the six months ended June , and , respectively. Cashflows from deferred annuity sales increase investment contractdeposits, which are a component of financing activities, as well asthe purchase of fixed maturities, which are a component of investingactivities. The decrease in cash flows provided by financingactivities for the first six months of compared to the first sixmonths of is due to lower ratio of annuity deposits towithdrawals. In addition to cash flows from operating and financingactivities, a substantial amount of liquid funds is available throughOxford\'s short-term portfolio.

These restrictions are notexpected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of AMERCO tomeet its cash obligation.Consolidated Group During each of the fiscal years ended March , , and, U-Haul estimates gross capital expenditures will averageapproximately million primarily reflecting rental fleet rotation.This level of capital expenditures, combined with an average ofapproximately - million in annual long-term debt maturitiesduring this same period, are expected to create annual average fundingneeds of approximately - million. Management estimates thatU-Haul will fund of these requirements with internally generatedfunds, including proceeds from the disposition of older trucks andother asset sales.Credit Agreements AMERCO\'s operations are funded by various credit and financingarrangements, including unsecured long-term borrowings, unsecuredmedium-term notes, and revolving lines of credit with domestic andforeign banks. Principally to finance its fleet of trucks andtrailers, AMERCO routinely enters into sale and leasebacktransactions. As of September , , AMERCO had ,. millionin total notes and loans payable outstanding and unutilized lines ofcredit of approximately . million. Certain of AMERCO\'s credit agreements contain restrictivefinancial and other covenants, including, among others, covenants withrespect to incurring additional indebtedness, maintaining certainfinancial ratios, and placing certain additional liens on itsproperties and assets. At September , , AMERCO was incompliance with these covenants. AMERCO is further restricted in the issuance of certain types ofpreferred stock. AMERCO is prohibited from issuing shares ofpreferred stock that provide for any mandatory redemption, sinkingfund payment, or mandatory prepayment, or that allow the holdersthereof to require AMERCO or any subsidiary of AMERCO to repurchasesuch preferred stock at the option of such holders or upon theoccurrence of any event or events without the consent of its lenders.<PAGE> Year Disclosure AMERCO is and has been working since to identify andcomplete the changes necessary to its existing computerized businesssystems to make these systems compliant for Year processing. TheYear processing problem is caused by currently installed computersystems and software products, including several used by AMERCO, beingcoded to accept only the last two digit entries in the date code fieldinstead of four digits to indicate the year. Such programs mayinterpret the year to mean instead, producing erroneousinformation or date-related computer failures. AMERCO\'s date reliance functions related to the Year andbeyond, such as rental transaction processing and financial systems,may be adversely affected unless these computer systems are or becomeYear compliant on a timely basis. Replacing, upgrading ormodifying key financial systems has been on-going in the normal courseof business. AMERCO is utilizing both internal and external resourcesto identify, correct, reprogram and test its systems for Year compliance. In particular, AMERCO has an outside consulting firm on-site currently making the Year compliance related modificationsto existing systems. AMERCO\'s internal information technologyconversion phase is underway, with the testing phase going on at thesame time. AMERCO has communicated with its major business partners todetermine the efforts being made on their part for compliance.Electronic data interchange with critical vendors has been tested.Testing has been completed with major banking partners and credit cardprocessors. Approximately of major business partners have givenAMERCO written assurances that they will be Year compliant.However, there can be no assurance AMERCO will not be adversely affected bythe failure of others to become Year compliant. For example, AMERCOmay be affected by, among other things, the failure of inventorysuppliers, credit card processors, security companies or other vendorsand service providers to become Year compliant. AMERCO expects all of its critical systems to be Year compliant by calendar year end. AMERCO started with aninitial budget of . million; as the conversion process continued,this amount was increased to . million. Through September ,, . million has been incurred for Year related work.AMERCO has not deferred any major computer programming or updateprojects due to Year efforts. Although AMERCO believes it willachieve compliance on a timely basis, no assurance can be given thatAMERCO\'s computer systems will be Year compliant in a timely manneror that AMERCO will not incur significant additional costs pursuingYear compliance. If the appropriate modifications are not made,or are not timely, the Year problem may have a material adverseeffect on AMERCO. AMERCO considers its most likely worst case scenario to be if abusiness partner is not Year compliant and direct processing of electronicdata is inhibited. AMERCO\'s contingency plan, to be used if a business partneris not Year compliant, will include manual processing of rentaltransactions; manual preparation of payments to employees, vendors andclaimants; manual licensing of equipment; manual preparation of financialstatements and the movement of funds. AMERCO expects that the cost ofconducting business manually would not have a material impact on its financialposition. While AMERCO feels testing has been adequate and successful, thecontingency plans have been formulated, with refinement continuing until theyear . Despite AMERCO\'s efforts to date, there can be no assurance thatthe Year problem will not have a material adverse effect onAMERCO in the future.<PAGE> ITEM .']","['Item .

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInterest Rate Risk In the normal course of business, AMERCO is exposed to fluctuationsin interest rates. AMERCO manages such exposure by the use of a varietyof derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. AMERCO does notenter into leveraged financial transactions or use derivative financialinstruments for trading purposes. The exposure to market risk forchanges in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations.AMERCO's objective is to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rateson its variable rate debt. AMERCO uses interest rate swap agreements toprovide for matching the gain or loss recognition on the hedginginstrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value ofhedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk or the earningseffect of the hedged forecasted transaction. See Note of Notes toConsolidated Financial Statements. A fluctuation of the interest rate by basis points would change AMERCO's interest expense by . million.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk AMERCO's earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value offoreign currency exchange rates. Approximately . of AMERCO's revenueis generated in Canada. The result of a uniform change in the valueof the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar would not be material.AMERCO does not typically hedge any foreign currency risk since theexposure is not considered material.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInterest Rate Risk In the normal course of business, AMERCO is exposed to fluctuations ininterest rates. AMERCO manages such exposure by the use of a variety ofderivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. AMERCO does not enterinto leveraged financial transactions or use derivative financial instrumentsfor trading purposes. The exposure to market risk for changes in interest ratesrelates primarily to debt obligations. AMERCO's objective is to mitigate theimpact of changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt. AMERCO usesinterest rate swap agreements to provide for matching the gain or lossrecognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in thefair value of hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk or theearnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction. See Note of Notes toConsolidated Financial Statements in Item . A fluctuation of the interest rateby basis points would change AMERCO's interest expense by . million.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk AMERCO's earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of foreigncurrency exchange rates. Approximately . of AMERCO's revenue is generated inCanada. The result of a uniform change in the value of the U.S. dollarrelative to the Canadian dollar would not be material. AMERCO does nottypically hedge any foreign currency risk since the exposure is not consideredmaterial. ITEM ""]",

MANAGEMENT\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW The Company is one of the largest manufacturers and marketers of nationallybranded and private label paper-based office products (excluding copy paper) inthe billion to billion North American office products industry. TheCompany offers a broad assortment of products including writing pads, filefolders, envelopes, machine papers and other paper-based products. Through itsAmpad division, the Company is among the largest suppliers of pads and otherpaper-based writing products, filing supplies, machine papers and retailenvelopes to many of the largest and fastest growing office productsdistributors. Through its Williamhouse division, the Company is the leadingsupplier of mill branded, specialty and commodity business envelopes to papermerchants and distributors. The Company believes that its future operatingresults will not be directly comparable to its historical operating resultsbecause of its strategic acquisitions. The Company\'s business has not generallybeen seasonal in nature. Certain factors which have affected, and may affectprospectively, the operating results of the Company are discussed below. Strategic Acquisitions. On October , , the Company acquiredWilliamhouse, a leading supplier of envelopes to many of the largest and fastestgrowing distributors, for an aggregate purchase price (including assumption ofdebt) of approximately . million plus reimbursement of certain expenses tothe sellers. On June , , the Company acquired Niagara, a national supplierof envelopes to fast growing distributors, for an aggregate purchase price ofapproximately . million, including costs of the acquisition and a millionone year consulting agreement with Niagara\'s former president. With theseacquisitions, the Company became the largest supplier of envelopes to thenational paper merchants. The Williamhouse acquisition was financed through theCompany\'s old bank credit agreement and the assumption of senior subordinatednotes. The Niagara acquisition was financed with proceeds from the sale of thePersonalizing Division of Williamhouse. On February , , the Company acquired ShadeAllied, a nationalsupplier of machine papers, principally continuous computer forms. The purchaseprice of . million was financed with borrowings under the Company\'s bankcredit agreement. ShadeAllied\'s products are distributed by both the Ampad andWilliamhouse divisions and the manufacturing plants are integrated into theAmpad division. This acquisition provided the Company with a more significantposition in a fourth product category. On August , , the Company acquired the file folder and hanging fileproduct lines of Atapco\'s Globe-Weis office products division. Atapco was one ofthe leading providers of file folders and hanging files to office productssuperstores. The aggregate acquisition consideration of . million, includingfees and expenses, was financed through the incurrence of bank debt and sellernotes. The Globe-Weis acquisition further strengthened the Company\'s position inthe filing supplies and writing products categories. Purchase Accounting Effects. The Company\'s acquisitions have been accountedfor using the purchase accounting method. The acquisitions have currentlyaffected, and will prospectively affect, the Company\'s results of operations incertain significant respects. The aggregate acquisition costs (includingassumption of debt) are allocated to the net assets acquired based on the fairmarket value of such net assets. The allocations of the purchase price result inan increase in the historical book value of certain assets such as property,plant and equipment and intangible assets, including goodwill, which results inincremental annual depreciation and amortization expense each year. Raw Material. The Company\'s principal raw material is paper. Certaincommodity grades utilized by the Company have shown considerable pricevolatility since . This volatility negatively impacted the Company\'searnings in as a result of the Company\'s inability to implement pricechanges in many of its product lines without giving its customers advancenotification. Beginning in January , the Company adopted new pricingpolicies enabling it to set product prices consistent with the Company\'s cost ofpaper at the time of shipment. From May through October , all but oneof the key commodity grades of paper utilized by the Company increased in costbetween and . Due to strategic customer considerations and competitivemarket conditions, the Company did not begin to recover a significant portion ofthe increases in paper costs affecting both its divisions until December .The Company continued to <PAGE> implement sales pricing increases during the first quarter of . Paper pricevolatility is expected to continue to have an effect on net sales and cost ofsales and there is no assurance that the Company will not be materially affectedby future fluctuations in the price of paper. Fluctuations in paper prices canhave an effect on quarterly comparisons of the results of operations andfinancial condition of the Company. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table summarizes the Company\'s historical results ofoperations as a percentage of net sales for each year in the three year periodended December , . The Company\'s historical results of operations for eachof these periods are significantly affected by the results for the followingbusinesses acquired by the Company: (i) the results of Globe-Weiss which wasacquired August , ; (ii) Williamhouse which was acquired on October ,; (iii) Niagara which was acquired on June , ; and (iv) ShadeAlliedwhich was acquired on February , . <TABLE><CAPTION> YEAR ENDED DECEMBER , --------------------------- ----- ----- -----<S> <C> <C> <C>INCOME STATEMENT DATA: Net sales................................................. . . . ===== ===== ===== Gross profit.............................................. . . .

Of this sales increase, . million is due tothe acquisition of ShadeAllied and . million is due to the inclusion of afull year of sales from the acquisition of Niagara. Excluding sales generated bythe ShadeAllied and Niagara acquisitions, sales from the Ampad divisionincreased . million and sales from the Williamhouse division declined .million. The increase in sales from the Ampad division is due primarily toincreased sales volume with the office products superstores and mass marketretail customers. The sales decline for the Williamhouse division is primarilydue to lower average selling prices in due to competitive market conditionsduring the year and partly to lower volumes of envelopes sold. Gross profit decreased from . million, or . of net sales, in to . million, or . of net sales, in . This . million decrease isprimarily due to increased paper, material and labor costs which the Company didnot recover. During , the Company\'s gross profit in the Ampad division wasnegatively affected by sales price incentives provided to the division\'s rapidlygrowing office superstores and mass merchants. Additionally, the Company\'s grossprofit in the Williamhouse division was negatively affected by competitivemarket sales pricing conditions. These factors combined with higher material andlabor costs led to significantly lower gross profit in than in . During, the Company incurred approximately . million in one-time costs relatingto training personnel on new equipment, the training <PAGE> time needed to expand to hour day shifts and the move to the new Salt Lakefacility. Additionally, the Company incurred . million in fixed costs in for former ShadeAllied and Williamhouse plants which were closed during and will not recur in .

During , the average level of accounts receivable sold tothe trust was higher than in and, as a result the losses on sales ofaccounts receivable were higher. The losses on sales of accounts receivablerepresent the Company\'s cost of using the third party trust to provide offbalance sheet financing of trade accounts receivable. Goodwill and intangible asset amortization expense increased from .million in to . million in , an increase of . million, dueprimarily to a full year of amortization of goodwill associated with theacquisition of Niagara and ten and one-half months of amortization of goodwillassociated with the acquisition of ShadeAllied. Management fees and services expense for the year ended December , amounted to . million as compared to . million for the year ended December, . The change in management fees is due primarily to the capitalizationof . million in Bain Capital fees in related to the acquisition ofShade Allied. Interest expense decreased from . million in to . million in, representing a decrease of . million. Such decrease was due primarilyto the refinancing of the Company\'s credit agreement in July , whichresulted in lower effective interest rates generating an interest savings of. million, and the repayment of . million in senior subordinated notes inAugust , which led to an interest expense reduction of approximately .million. These savings were offset by . million additional interest expensedue to increases in long-term debt associated with the acquisition ofShadeAllied and approximately . million additional interest expense as aresult of the Company\'s investment in working capital and net increase incapital expenditures. The income tax provision for the year ended December , reflects aneffective income tax provision rate of . as compared with the effectiveincome tax rate of . for the year ended December , .

Interest expense for the year ended December , increased .million to . million from . million for the year ended December ,. The increase is attributable primarily to higher levels of outstandingdebt for a full year as a result of the acquisition of Williamhouse andGlobe-Weis. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by a reductionof approximately . million in interest expense following the redemption of. million of the senior subordinated notes in August . The income tax provision for year ended December , reflects aneffective tax rate of . versus an effective tax benefit rate of . forthe year ended December , . The effective tax rate for reflects a combined statutory federal and state income tax rate adjusted for nondeductibleexpenses, primarily goodwill amortization. The effective tax rate for the yearended December , differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of due to state income taxes and the reversal of a valuation allowance ondeferred tax assets relating to the realizability of the Company\'s net operatingloss carryforward.

The increase in cash provided by operatingactivities is primarily due to higher net sales and earnings of the Company in. The net cash provided for the year ended December , resultedprimarily from an increase of . million in accounts payable, an increase inaccrued expenses of . million, a decrease in inventories and increasedmargins on sales. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December , wasdue to the acquisition of ShadeAllied for . million and purchases ofproperty and equipment for . million, offset by proceeds from sales ofequipment and a closed plant for . million. Cash used in investing activitiesfor the year ended December , and was . million and .million, respectively. The use of cash for the year ended December , wasprincipally due to the Niagara acquisition (. million, net of cash received)and purchases of equipment (. million), offset by proceeds from the sale ofthe Regency Division and other assets held for sale (. million). The use ofcash for the year ended December , , was due to the Williamhouseacquisition (. million), the Globe-Weis acquisition (. million) andpurchase of equipment (. million). Cash was provided by financing activities in by increased borrowingunder the Company\'s revolving credit agreement of . million offset by .million in payments on industrial revenue bonds and capitalized leaseobligations. At the end of , the Company had sold an additional millionof accounts receivable to the third party trust. Cash used in financingactivities for the year ended December , was . million as compared toa cash provision from financing activities of . million for the year endedDecember , . During the year ended December , , the Company (i)completed its initial public offering of . million shares of common stock for. million in net proceeds after deducting offering fees and expenses, (ii)refinanced its accounts receivable facility with a new . million facility,(iii) refinanced its bank credit agreement, (iv) redeemed . million ofsenior subordinated notes, (v) repaid . million of debt incurred under theold bank credit agreement, (vi) paid . million in redemption premiums on theNotes, (vii) repaid million under the new accounts receivable facility withproceeds from the sale of the Regency Division, (viii) borrowed millionunder the new accounts receivable facility and (ix) repaid WR seller notes for million Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December, was . million primarily due to periodic financings incurred inconnection with the various acquisitions. In February , the Company and its banking group agreed to an increasein the size of the revolving credit agreement from . million to .million for a period of one year. After such time, the level of debt availableunder such credit agreement will be reduced to . million. In December and February , certain covenants in the credit agreement were also modifiedat the end of and for a one year period ending in February . TheCompany will not be subject to a consolidated debt to EBITDA ratio until thefirst quarter of . Interest coverage ratios will be measured quarterlybeginning January , . Unless approved by the banking group, the Companywill be restricted to . million in net capital expenditures for andwill be restricted from any acquisitions. The interest cost incurred by theCompany will vary each quarter in depending on the Company\'s consolidateddebt to EBITDA ratio at the beginning of each quarter. The Company paid a fee of. million to its banking group as part of the amendment to the creditagreement. <PAGE> The ability of the Company to ""comply with the covenants in the creditagreement,"" meet its debt service obligations and reduce its total debt will bedependent upon the future performance of the Company and its subsidiaries which,in turn, will be subject to general economic conditions and to financial,business and other factors, including factors beyond the Company\'s control. ""Theoperating results for the month of January were lower than management\'sexpectations due to the timing of the implementation of price increases andproduct line rationalization. As a result, the Company is uncertain whether itsoperating performance for the first quarter of will be in full compliancewith covenants in its credit agreement. In the event the Company does not meetthe covenants, the Company will need to seek waiver from its banking group. Aportion of the consolidated debt of the Company bears interest at floatingrates; therefore, its financial condition is and will continue to be affected bychanges in prevailing interest rates. The Company has entered into an interestrate protection agreement to minimize the impact from a rise in interest rates. Management believes that based on current levels of operations andanticipated internal growth, cash flow from operations, together with otheravailable sources of funds including borrowings under the bank credit agreementand the accounts receivable facility and available cash on hand at December , of . million, will be adequate for to make required payments ofprincipal and interest on the Company\'s indebtedness, to fund anticipatedcapital expenditures of million in , and to meet working capitalrequirements. The amount of debt available under the Company\'s current credit agreementdecreases by . million in February and by an additional . millionin July . Based on the Company\'s current level of operating results and theexpected operating results in and , the Company expects that thereduction of . million in February will not have a significant effecton its operations. However, the reduction in available borrowing of .million at the end of may require the Company to explore other financingalternatives, including but not limited to a refinancing of its bank debt,raising new private or public debt, raising additional public equity capital,reducing the level of capital expenditures, reducing operating costs and sellingcertain assets. In the event that the Company is not able to successfullycomplete the financing alternatives just described, the Company and its bankinggroup would be required to negotiate revisions to the terms of the creditagreement. INFLATION The Company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on itsresults of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December, . NEWLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS During the fourth quarter of , the Company adopted Statement ofFinancial Accounting Standards No. , Earnings Per Share (""SFAS ""). Suchadoption resulted in a new presentation of earnings per share amounts as either""basic"" or ""diluted."" Basic earnings per share is calculated as net incomedivided by the number of outstanding shares of common stock. Diluted earningsper share is calculated in a manner similar to the ""primary"" earnings per sharepreviously presented by the Company. Diluted earnings per share is calculated asnet income divided by the number of outstanding shares of common stock, asadjusted for common stock options. The Company has restated its quarterlyearnings per share to present such information in accordance with the newaccounting standard. In February , the Securities and Exchange Commission issued StaffAccounting Bulletin No. (""SAB "") which requires the Company to presenthistorical earnings per share for pre-IPO periods even if such information,historically, was not considered meaningful, in order to be consistent with SFAS. However, in accordance with SAB , changes in the Company\'s capitalstructure at the time of the initial public offering relative to preferred stockand preferred stock options conversion to common stock and common stock optionsare not presented retroactively. In addition, the number of common shares issuedduring the Company\'s initial public offering is not retroactively restated. Theweighted average common shares outstanding under the basic and diluted methodsdescribed in the preceding paragraph reflect only common stock or common stockoptions actually outstanding for the periods presented. The .-for-one <PAGE> common stock split by the Company at the time of its initial public offering hasbeen retroactively restated for all periods presented. Two new accounting standards, Statement of Financial Accounting StandardsNo. , Reporting Comprehensive Income, and No. , Disclosures About Segmentsof an Enterprise and Related Information, will take effect during the firstquarter of . The Company does not expect that the adoption of such newaccounting standards will have any significant effects on the Company\'s reportedfinancial information.

(AT&T or the company) is among the world\'s communicationsleaders, providing voice, data, video and broadband telecommunications servicesto large and small businesses, consumers and government agencies. We providedomestic and international long distance; regional, local and wirelesscommunications services; cable television and Internet communication services.AT&T also provides billing, directory and calling-card services to support ourcommunications businesses.MERGER WITH MEDIAONE GROUP, INC. We completed the merger with MediaOne Group, Inc. (MediaOne) on June, , in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately billion.We issued approximately million shares, of which million were treasuryshares, and made cash payments of approximately billion. The merger was recorded under the purchase method of accounting, andaccordingly, the results of MediaOne have been included with the financialresults of AT&T, within our Broadband segment, since the date of acquisition.Periods prior to the merger were not restated to include the results ofMediaOne.TRACKING STOCKS On April , , AT&T issued a new class of stock to track theperformance of AT&T Wireless Group. AT&T sold million shares of AT&TWireless Group tracking shares at a price of . per share. The millionshares track approximately of the financial performance of AT&T WirelessGroup. In addition, in connection with the acquisition ofTele-Communications, Inc. (TCI), renamed AT&T Broadband (Broadband), AT&T issueda separate tracking stock to reflect the financial performance of Liberty MediaGroup (LMG), TCI\'s former programming and technology investment businesses. Theoutstanding Liberty Media Group tracking stock tracks of the financialperformance of LMG. The remaining results of operations of AT&T, including approximately of the financial performance of AT&T Wireless Group, are referred to as theAT&T Common Stock Group and are represented by AT&T common stock. A tracking stock is designed to provide financial returns to itsholders based on the financial performance and economic value of the assets ittracks. Ownership of shares of AT&T common stock, AT&T Wireless Group trackingstock or Liberty Media Class A or B tracking stock does not represent a directlegal interest in the assets and liabilities of any of the groups, but anownership of AT&T in total. The specific shares represent an interest in theeconomic performance of the net assets of each of the groups. The earnings attributable to AT&T Wireless Group representapproximately of the earnings from April , , through December ,, and are excluded from the earnings available to AT&T Common Stock Group.Similarly, the earnings and losses related to LMG are excluded from the earningsavailable to AT&T Common Stock Group.<PAGE> We do not have a controlling financial interest in LMG for financialaccounting purposes; therefore, our ownership in LMG is reflected as aninvestment accounted for under the equity method in AT&T\'s consolidatedfinancial statements. The amounts attributable to LMG are reflected in theaccompanying consolidated financial statements as ""Equity earnings (losses) fromLiberty Media Group"" and ""Investment in Liberty Media Group and relatedreceivables, net"".RESTRUCTURING OF AT&T On October , , we announced a restructuring plan designed tofully separate or issue separately tracked stocks intended to reflect thefinancial performance and economic value of each of the company\'s four majoroperating units. Upon completion of the plan, AT&T Wireless, AT&T Broadband,AT&T Business and AT&T Consumer will all be represented by asset-based ortracking stocks. As part of the first phase of the restructuring plan, we are planningan exchange offer that will give AT&T shareowners the opportunity to exchangeany portion of their AT&T common shares for shares of AT&T Wireless Grouptracking stock, subject to pro-ration. Following the exchange offer and subjectto specified conditions, AT&T plans to split-off AT&T Wireless Group from AT&T.We intend, however, to retain up to billion of shares of AT&T Wireless forfuture sale, exchange or monetization within six months following the split-off.We expect AT&T Wireless will become an independent, publicly-held company inmid-, upon receipt of appropriate tax and other approvals. In addition to the split-off of AT&T Wireless, we intend to fullyseparate or issue separate tracking stocks to reflect the financial performanceand economic value of each of our other major business units. We plan to createand issue new classes of stock to track the financial performance and economicvalue of our AT&T Broadband unit and AT&T Consumer unit. We plan to sell somepercentage of shares of the AT&T Broadband unit in the fall of . Within months of such sale, we intend to completely separate AT&T Broadband from AT&T,as an asset-based stock. The AT&T Consumer tracking stock is expected to befully distributed to AT&T shareowners in the second half of . AT&T expects that these transactions will be tax-free to U.S.shareholders. AT&T\'s restructuring plan is complicated and involves asubstantial number of steps and transactions, including obtaining variousconditions, such as Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rulings. In addition, futurefinancial conditions, superior alternatives or other factors may arise or occurthat make it inadvisable to proceed with part or all of AT&T\'s restructuringplan. Any or all of the elements of AT&T\'s restructuring plan may not occur aswe currently expect or in the timeframes that we currently contemplate, or atall. Alternative forms of restructuring, including sales of interests in thesebusinesses, would reduce what is available for distribution to shareowners inthe restructuring. On November , , we announced that our board of directors voted tosplit-off LMG. A new asset-based security will be issued to holders of LMGtracking stock in exchange for their LMG tracking shares. The split-off remainssubject to receipt of a favorable tax ruling from the IRS. We expect thissplit-off to be completed in mid-.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This document may contain forward-looking statements with respect toAT&T\'s restructuring plan, financial condition, results of operations, cash<PAGE>flows, dividends, financing plans, business strategies, operating efficienciesor synergies, budgets, capital and other expenditures, network build out andupgrade, competitive positions, availability of capital, growth opportunitiesfor existing products, benefits from new technologies, availability anddeployment of new technologies, plans and objectives of management, and othermatters.

Moreover, in thefuture, AT&T, through its senior management, may make forward-looking statementsabout the matters described in this document or other matters concerning AT&T. The discussion and analysis that follows provides informationmanagement believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of AT&T\'sconsolidated results of operations for the years ended December , , and , and financial condition as of December , and .CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The comparison of results with was impacted by events, suchas acquisitions and dispositions that occurred during these two years. For<PAGE>example, in we acquired MediaOne and wireless properties in the SanFrancisco Bay area, which were both included in our results for part of theyear, but were not in results. In , we acquired TCI, the IBM GlobalNetwork (now AT&T Global Network Services, or AGNS) and Vanguard CellularSystems, Inc. (Vanguard). These businesses were included in results for afull year, but only a part of (since their respective dates ofacquisition). Further, we disposed of certain international businesses during and . The results of businesses sold in were included in results for part of the year, and were not in results. Likewise, businessessold in were included in results for the full year and in resultsfor part of the year. Year-over-year comparison was also impacted by the consolidation of AtHome Corp. (Excite@Home) beginning September , , due tocorporate-governance changes which gave AT&T a controlling interest. At thattime and on December , , we had an approximate economic interest and voting interest in Excite@Home. Prior to September , , we accounted forour ownership in Excite@Home under the equity method of accounting, which meansour investment was included in ""Other investments and related advances"" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and any earnings or losses were included as acomponent of ""Net losses from other equity investments"" in the ConsolidatedStatements of Income. The consolidation of Excite@Home resulted in the inclusionof of its results in each line item of AT&T\'s Consolidated Balance Sheetand Consolidated Income Statement. The approximate we do not own is shown inthe Consolidated Balance Sheet within ""Minority interest"" and as acomponent of ""Minority interest income (expense)"" in the ConsolidatedStatement of Income. On January , , we launched Concert, our global joint venture withBritish Telecommunications plc (BT). AT&T contributed all of its internationalgateway-to-gateway assets and the economic value of approximately multinational customers specifically targeted for direct sales by Concert. As aresult, results do not include the revenue and expenses associated withthese customers and businesses, while does, and results include ourproportionate share of Concert\'s earnings in ""Net losses from other equityinvestments."" Effective July , , the FCC eliminated Primary InterexchangeCarrier Charges (PICC or per-line charges) that AT&T pays for residential andsingle-line business customers. The elimination of these per-line chargesresulted in lower access expense as well as lower revenue, since AT&T hashistorically billed its customers for these charges. The comparison of results with was also impacted by the acquisitions of TCI, AGNS and Vanguard, since results include thesebusinesses for part of the year, while does not include them. Thiscomparison is also impacted by the dispositions of internationalbusinesses, which were included in results for part of the year, but werein results for the full year.<TABLE><CAPTION>For the Years Ended December , ---- ---- ---- Dollars in millions<S> <C> <C> <C>Business Services..................................................... , , ,Consumer Services..................................................... , , ,Wireless Services..................................................... , , ,Broadband............................................................. , , --Other and Corporate...................................................

Approximately . billion of the increase was due to the impactof acquisitions and the consolidation of Excite@Home, offset by the impact ofConcert, dispositions and the elimination of PICC. The remaining . billionincrease was primarily driven by a growing demand for our wireless and data andInternet protocol (IP) products, and outsourcing services, partially offset bycontinued and accelerating declines in long distance voice revenue. We expectlong distance revenue to continue to be negatively impacted by ongoingcompetition and product substitution. Total revenue in increased . billion, or ., compared with. Nearly three-quarters of the increase was due to acquisitions, net ofdispositions. The remaining increase was fueled by growth in wireless, businessdata, business long distance voice and outsourcing revenue, partially offset bythe continued decline of consumer long distance voice revenue.

These costs increased . billion, or ., in compared with. Nearly . billion of the increase was due to acquisitions and the impactof consolidating Excite@Home, net of the impact of Concert and divestments ofinternational businesses. The higher costs associated with our growing wirelesssubscriber base and wireless network as well as new outsourcing contractsincreased expenses by approximately . billion. The higher wireless expensesprimarily related to higher costs of handsets sold, due to a . increase ingross subscriber additions in compared with . Expenses also increaseddue to higher video-programming costs principally due to rate increases, andhigher costs associated with new broadband services of approximately .billion. These increases were partially offset by approximately . billion ofcosts savings from continued cost control initiatives and a higher pensioncredit in , primarily driven by a higher pension trust asset base, resultingfrom increased investment returns. Costs of services and products rose . billion, or ., in compared with , primarily due to acquisitions, net of dispositions, whichaccounted for approximately . billion of the increase. The higher costsassociated with our growing wireless subscriber base as well as new outsourcingcontracts increased expenses by approximately . billion.

Included within access and otherconnection expenses are costs that we pay to connect domestic calls on thefacilities of other service providers. Mandated reductions in per-minute accesscosts and decreased per-line charges resulted in lower costs of approximately. billion. Also contributing to the decrease was more efficient networkusage. These decreases were partially offset by approximately . billion ofhigher costs due to volume increases, and . billion as a result of higherUniversal Service Fund contributions. Since most of these charges are passedthrough to the customer, the per-minute access-rate and per-line chargereductions and the increased Universal Service Fund contributions have generallyresulted in a corresponding impact on revenue. Costs paid to telephone companies outside of the United States toconnect calls made to countries outside of the United States (internationalsettlements) are also included within access and other connection expenses.These costs decreased approximately . billion in , as result of thecommencement of operations of Concert. Concert now incurs most of ourinternational settlements as well as earns most of our foreign-billed revenue,previously incurred and earned directly by AT&T. In , Concert billed us anet expense composed of international settlement (interconnection) expense andforeign-billed revenue. The amount charged by Concert in was lower thaninterconnection expense incurred in , since AT&T recorded these transactionsas revenue and expense, as applicable. Partially offsetting the decline werecosts incurred related to Concert products that AT&T now sells to its customers. Access and other connection expenses declined . billion, or ., in compared with the prior year. This decline resulted from . billion ofmandated reductions in per-minute access rates in and , and .billion of lower international settlement rates resulting from our negotiationswith international carriers. Additionally, we continue to manage these coststhrough more efficient network usage. These reductions were partially offset by. billion of higher costs due to volume growth, and . billion as a resultof increased per-line charges and Universal Service Fund contributions.<TABLE><CAPTION>For the Years Ended December , ---- ---- ---- Dollars in millions<S> <C> <C> <C>Selling, general and administrative................................... , , ,<TABLE> Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased .billion, or ., in compared with .

Amortization of goodwill, franchise costs and other purchasedintangibles increased . billion in compared with due primarily tothe acquisition of TCI and, to a lesser extent, AGNS.<TABLE><CAPTION>For the Years Ended December , ---- ---- ---- Dollars in millions<S> <C> <C> <C>Net restructuring and other charges....................................... , , ,<TABLE><PAGE> During , we recorded . billion of net restructuring and othercharges, which had an approximate . earnings per diluted share impact to theAT&T Common Stock Group. The charge included . billion of assetimpairment charges related to Excite@Home, million for restructuring andexit costs associated with AT&T\'s initiative to reduce costs, and millionrelated to the government-mandated disposition of AT&T Communications (U.K.)Ltd., which would have competed directly with Concert. The asset impairment charges related to Excite@Home resulted from thedeterioration of the market conditions and market valuations of Internet-relatedcompanies during the fourth quarter of , which caused Excite@Home toconclude that intangible assets related to their acquisitions ofInternet-related companies may not be recoverable. Accordingly, Excite@Homeconducted a detailed assessment of the recoverability of the carrying amounts ofacquired intangible assets. This assessment resulted in a determination thatcertain acquired intangible assets, including goodwill, related to theseacquisitions, including Excite, were impaired as of December , . As aresult, Excite@Home recorded impairment charges of . billion in December, representing the excess of the carrying amount of the impaired assets overtheir fair value. The impairment was allocated to each asset group based on a comparisonof carrying values and fair values. The impairment write-down within each assetgroup was allocated first to goodwill, and if goodwill was reduced to zero, toidentifiable intangible assets in proportion to carrying values. Since we own approximately of Excite@Home, of the chargerecorded by Excite@Home was not included as a reduction to AT&T\'s net income,but rather was eliminated in our Consolidated Statement of Income as""Minority interest income (expense)."" Also as a result of the foregoing, AT&T recorded a goodwill andacquisition-related impairment charge of . billion associated with theacquisition of our investment in Excite@Home. The write-down of our investmentto fair value was determined utilizing discounted expected future cash flows. The million charge for restructuring and exit plans was primarilydue to headcount reductions, mainly in network operations and Business Services,including the consolidation of customer-care and call centers, as well assynergies created by the MediaOne merger. Included in exit costs was million of cash termination benefitsassociated with the separation of approximately , employees as part ofvoluntary and involuntary termination plans. Approximately one-half of theseparations were management employees and one-half were nonmanagement employees.Approximately , employee separations were related to involuntaryterminations and approximately to voluntary terminations. We also recorded million of network lease and other contracttermination costs associated with penalties incurred as part of notifyingvendors of the termination of these contracts during the year, and net losses of million related to the disposition of facilities primarily due to synergiescreated by the MediaOne merger. Also included in restructuring and exit costs in was millionof benefit plan curtailment costs associated with employee separations as partof these exit plans. Further, we recorded an asset impairment charge of million related to the write-down of unrecoverable assets in certain businesseswhere the carrying value was no longer supported by estimated future cash flows.<PAGE> The restructuring initiatives are projected to yield cash savingsof approximately million per year, as well as EBIT (earnings beforeinterest and taxes, including pretax minority interest and net pretax lossesfrom other equity investments) savings of approximately million per year.We expect increased spending in growth businesses will largely offset these cashand EBIT savings. The EBIT savings, primarily attributable to reducedpersonnel-related expenses, will be realized in SG&A expenses and costs ofservices and products. During , we recorded . billion of net restructuring and othercharges, which had an approximate . earnings per diluted share impact to theAT&T Common Stock Group. A million in-process research and development charge was recordedreflecting the estimated fair value of research and development projects at TCI,as of the date of the acquisition, which had not yet reached technologicalfeasibility or had no alternative future use. The projects identified related toefforts to offer voice over IP, product-integration efforts for advanced set-topdevices, cost-savings efforts for broadband-telephony implementation, andin-process research and development related to Excite@Home. We estimated thefair value of in-process research and development for each project using anincome approach, which was adjusted to allocate fair value based on theproject\'s percentage of completion. Under this approach, the present value ofthe anticipated future benefits of the projects was determined using a discountrate of . For each project, the resulting net present value was multiplied bya percentage of completion based on effort expended to date versus projectedcosts to complete. The charge associated with voice-over-IP technology, which allows voicetelephony traffic to be digitized and transmitted in IP data packets, was million as of the date of acquisition. Current voice-over-IP equipment does notyet support many of the features required to connect customer premises equipmentto traditional phone networks. Further technical development is also needed toensure voice quality that is comparable to conventional circuit-switchedtelephony and to reduce the power consumption of the IP-telephony equipment. Westarted testing IP-telephony equipment in the field in late- and willcontinue tests throughout . The charge associated with product-integration efforts for advancedset-top devices, which will enable us to offer next-generation digital services,was million as of the acquisition date. The associated technology consistsof the development and integration work needed to provide a suite of softwaretools to run on the digital set-top box hardware platform. It is anticipatedthat field trials will begin in late- for next-generation digital services. The charge associated with cost-savings efforts for broadband-telephonyimplementation was million as of the date of acquisition. Telephony costreductions primarily consist of cost savings from the development of a ""line ofpower switch,"" which allows us to cost effectively provide power for customertelephony equipment through the cable plant. This device will allow us toprovide line-powered telephony without burying the cable line to each house.Trials related to our telephony cost reductions are complete, and implementationhas begun in certain markets. Additionally, the in-process research and development charge related toExcite@Home was valued at million. This charge related to projects to allowfor self-provisioning of devices and the development of next-generation clientsoftware, network and back-office infrastructure to enable a variety of networkdevices beyond personal computers and improved design for the regional datacenters\' infrastructure.<PAGE> Although there are technological issues to overcome to successfullycomplete the acquired in-process research and development, we expect successfulcompletion. We estimate the costs to complete the identified projects will nothave a material impact on our results of operations. If, however, we are unableto establish technological feasibility and produce commercially viableproductsservices, anticipated incremental future cash flows attributable toexpected profits from such new productsservices may not be realized. A million asset impairment charge was recorded in associatedwith the planned disposal of certain wireless communications equipment resultingfrom a program to increase the capacity and operating efficiency of our wirelessnetwork. As part of a multivendor program, contracts have been executed withselect vendors to replace significant portions of our wireless infrastructureequipment in the western United States and the metropolitan New York markets.The program is intended to provide Wireless Services with the newest technologyavailable and allow us to evolve to new, next-generation digital technology,which is designed to provide high-speed data capabilities. Since the assets willremain in service from the date of the decision to dispose of these assets tothe disposal date, the remaining net book value of the assets will bedepreciated over this period. Also in , a million charge for restructuring and exit costswas recorded as part of AT&T\'s initiative to reduce costs. The restructuring andexit plans primarily focused on the maximization of synergies through headcountreductions in Business Services and network operations, including theconsolidation of customer-care and call centers. Included in exit costs was million of cash termination benefitsassociated with the separation of approximately , employees as part ofvoluntary and involuntary termination plans. Approximately one-half of theseparations were management employees and one-half were nonmanagement employees.Approximately , employee separations were related to involuntaryterminations and approximately , to voluntary terminations. The restructuring initiatives are projected to yield cash savingsof approximately million per year. This restructuring yielded EBIT savingsof approximately million in , and is expected to save nearly million per year thereafter. We expect increased spending in growth businesseswill largely offset these cash and EBIT savings. The EBIT savings, primarilyattributable to reduced personnel-related expenses, will be realized in SG&Aexpenses and costs of services and products. We also recorded net losses of million related to thegovernment-mandated disposition of certain international businesses that wouldhave competed directly with Concert, and million related to a contributionagreement Broadband entered into with Phoenixstar, Inc. That agreement requiresBroadband to satisfy certain liabilities owed by Phoenixstar and itssubsidiaries. The remaining obligation under this contribution agreement and anagreement that MediaOne had is million, which was fully accrued for atDecember , . In addition, we recorded benefits of million related tothe settlement of pension obligations for former employees who accepted AT&T\'s voluntary retirement incentive program (VRIP) offer. During , we recorded . billion of net restructuring and othercharges, which had an approximate . earnings per diluted share impact to theAT&T Common Stock Group. The bulk of the charge was associated with our overallcost-reduction program and the approximately , management employees whoaccepted the VRIP offer. A restructuring charge of , million was composed<PAGE>of , million and million for pension and postretirementspecial-termination benefits, respectively, million of benefit plancurtailment losses and million of other administrative costs. We alsorecorded charges of million for related facility costs and million forexecutive-separation costs. These charges were partially offset by benefits of million as we settled pension benefit obligations for , of the totalVRIP employees. In addition, the VRIP charges were partially offset by thereversal of million of business restructuring reserves primarilyresulting from the overlap of VRIP on certain projects. Also included in the net restructuring and other charges wereasset impairment charges totaling million, of which million wasrelated to our decision not to pursue Total Service Resale (TSR) as alocal-service strategy. We also recorded an million asset impairment chargerelated to the write-down of unrecoverable assets in certain internationaloperations where the carrying value was no longer supported by future cashflows. This charge was made in connection with the review of certain operationsthat would have competed directly with Concert. Additionally, million of merger-related expenses were recorded in in connection with the Teleport Communications Group Inc. (TCG) merger,which was accounted for as a pooling of interests. Partially offsetting thesecharges was a million reversal of the restructuring reserve. Thisreversal reflected reserves no longer deemed necessary. The reversal primarilyincluded separation costs attributed to projects completed at a cost lower thanoriginally anticipated. Consistent with the three-year plan, the restructuring initiatives were substantially completed by the end of .<TABLE><CAPTION>For the Years Ended December , ---- ---- ---- Dollars in millions<S> <C> <C> <C>Operating income......................................................... , , ,<TABLE> Operating income decreased . billion, or ., in comparedwith .

The balance ofAT&T\'s operations, excluding LMG, is included in a Corporate and Other category.Although not a segment, we also discuss the results of LMG. The discussion of segment results includes revenue; EBIT (earningsbefore interest and taxes, including pretax minority interest and net pretaxlosses of other equity investments); EBITDA (EBIT plus depreciation,amortization and minority interest income (expense) other than Excite@Home);total assets, and capital additions. The discussion of EBITDA for WirelessServices and Broadband is modified to exclude other income and net losses fromequity investments. Total assets for each segment generally include all assets,except intercompany receivables. However, our Wireless Services segment includedintercompany receivables from AT&T and the related interest income since theseassets relate to the results of the AT&T Wireless Group tracked business.Prepaid pension assets and corporate-owned or leased real estate are generallyheld at the corporate level, and therefore are included in the Corporate andOther group. Shared network assets are allocated to the segments and reallocatedeach January, based on two years of volumes. Capital additions for each segmentinclude capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment, acquisitions oflicenses, additions to nonconsolidated investments, increases in franchise costsand additions to internal-use software.<PAGE> EBIT is the primary measure used by AT&T\'s chief operating decisionmakers to measure AT&T\'s operating results and to measure segment profitabilityand performance. AT&T calculates EBIT as operating income plus net pretax lossesfrom equity investments, pretax minority interest income (expense) and otherincome. In addition, management also uses EBITDA as a measure of segmentprofitability and performance, and is defined as EBIT, excluding minorityinterest income (expense) other than Excite@Home, plus depreciation andamortization. Interest and taxes are not factored into the segment profitabilitymeasure used by the chief operating decision makers; therefore, trends for theseitems are discussed on a consolidated basis. Management believes EBIT ismeaningful to investors because it provides analysis of operating results usingthe same measures used by AT&T\'s chief operating decision makers and provides areturn on total capitalization measure. We believe EBITDA is meaningful toinvestors as a measure of each segment\'s liquidity consistent with the measureutilized by our chief operating decision makers. In addition, we believe thatboth EBIT and EBITDA allow investors a means to evaluate the financial resultsof each segment in relation to total AT&T. EBIT for AT&T was . billion, .billion and . billion for the years ended December , , and ,respectively. EBITDA for AT&T was . billion, . billion and . billionfor the years ended December , , and , respectively. Ourcalculation of EBIT and EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculationof these measures by other public companies. EBIT and EBITDA should not beviewed by investors as an alternative to generally accepted accountingprinciples (GAAP) measures of income as a measure of performance or to cashflows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure ofliquidity. In addition, EBITDA does not take into account changes in certainassets and liabilities as well as interest and taxes which can affect cash flow. Reflecting the dynamics of our business, we continually review ourmanagement model and structure and make adjustments accordingly.BUSINESS SERVICES Our Business Services segment offers a variety of global communicationsservices, including long distance, local, and data and IP networking to smalland medium-sized businesses, large domestic and multinational businesses andgovernment agencies. Business Services is also a provider of voice, data and IPtransport to service resellers (wholesale services). Business Services includes AT&T Solutions, the company\'sprofessional-services outsourcing business, which provides seamless solutionsthat maximize the competitive advantage of networking-based electronicapplications for global clients. AT&T Solutions also provides e-infrastructureand high-availability services to enterprise clients, and manages AT&T\'s unifiedglobal network.<TABLE><CAPTION>For the Years Ended December , ---- ---- ---- Dollars in millions<S> <C> <C> <C>External revenue...................................................... , , ,Internal revenue......................................................

Approximately . billion of the increase was due to the impact ofacquisitions, partially offset by the formation of Concert. Strength in data andIP services as well as growth in our outsourcing business contributed .billion to the increase. This growth, however, was offset by an approximate .billion decline in long distance voice services as a result of continued pricingpressures in the industry. Revenue in grew . billion, or .. The acquisition of AGNScontributed approximately . billion to the growth. Data, IP and outsourcingservices grew approximately . billion in compared with , while longdistance voice services and local services contributed approximately .billion to the revenue increase. Data services, which represent the transportation of data, rather thanvoice, along our network, was impacted by acquisitions and the formation ofConcert. Excluding these impacts, data services grew at a high-teens percentagerate in . Growth was led by the continued strength of frame relay services;IP services, which include IP-connectivity services and virtual private network(VPN) services; and high-speed private-line services. Excluding the impact ofAGNS, data services grew at a high-teens percentage rate in , led bystrength in frame relay and high-speed private-line services. AT&T Solutions outsourcing revenue grew . in and . in. More than one-half of the growth and approximately of the growth was driven by our acquisition of AGNS. The remaining growth in both yearswas primarily due to growth from new contract signings and add-on business fromexisting clients. Excluding the impact of Concert, long distance voice services revenuedeclined at a mid single-digit percentage rate in due to a decliningaverage price per minute reflecting the competitive forces within the industrywhich are expected to continue. Partially offsetting this decline was a highsingle-digit percentage growth rate in minutes. In , long distance voicerevenue grew at a low single-digit percentage rate, as volumes grew at ahigh-teens percentage rate, which was largely offset by a declining average rateper minute. Local voice services revenue grew nearly in and more than in . During , AT&T added more than , access lines, with the totalreaching nearly . million at the end of the year.

Business Services internal revenue increased million, or ., in and million, or ., in . The increase in was the result ofgreater sales of business long distance services to other AT&T units that resellsuch services to their external customers, primarily Broadband and WirelessServices. The increase in was partially offset by a decline in salesrelated to international businesses divested. In , the increase in internalrevenue was primarily due to greater sales of long distance services to WirelessServices.<PAGE>EBITEBITDA EBIT improved . billion, or ., and EBITDA improved . billion,or ., in compared with . This improvement reflects an increase inrevenue and lower costs as a result of our continued cost-control efforts,partially offset by the formation of Concert and the acquisition of AGNS.Additionally, the EBIT increase was partially offset by an increase indepreciation and amortization expense in compared with primarily dueto a higher network asset base. In , EBIT improved . billion, or ., and EBITDA improved .billion, or ., compared with . These increases were driven by revenuegrowth combined with margin improvement resulting from ongoing cost-controlinitiatives. The increase in EBIT was offset somewhat by increased depreciationand amortization expenses resulting from increased capital expenditures aimed atdata, IP and local services.OTHER ITEMS Capital additions decreased . billion in , and increased .billion in . In , the decrease was a result of lower spending for ourlong distance network (including the data network). In , the increase wasprimarily due to additional spending for the build out of our local servicesSONET transport network. Total assets increased . billion, or ., at December , ,compared with December , . The increase was primarily due to net increasesin property, plant and equipment as a result of capital additions, and a higheraccounts receivable balance.CONSUMER SERVICES Our Consumer Services segment provides residential customers with avariety of any-distance communications services, including long distance, localtoll (intrastate calls outside the immediate local area) and Internet access. Inaddition, Consumer Services provides transaction services, such as prepaidcalling card and operator-handled calling services. Local phone service is alsoprovided in certain areas.<TABLE><CAPTION>For the Years Ended December , ---- ---- ---- Dollars in millions<S> <C> <C> <C>Revenue............................................................... , , ,EBIT.................................................................. , , ,EBITDA................................................................ , , ,Capital additions..................................................... At December , ---- ----Total assets.......................................................... , ,<TABLE><PAGE>REVENUE Consumer Services revenue declined ., or . billion, in compared with . Approximately . billion of the decline was due to theelimination of per-line charges in and the impact of Concert. The remainderof the decline was primarily due to a decline in traditional voice services,such as Domestic Dial , reflecting the ongoing competitive nature of theconsumer long distance industry, which has resulted in pricing pressures and aloss of market share. Also negatively impacting revenue was product substitutionand market migration away from direct-dial wireline and higher-pricedcalling-card services to the rapidly growing wireless services and lower-pricedprepaid-card services. As a result, calling volumes declined at a midsingle-digit percentage rate in . We expect competition and productsubstitution to continue to negatively impact Consumer Services revenue. In August , we introduced AT&T One Rate, which allows customers tomake long distance calls, hours a day, seven days a week, for the same rate.These One Rate offers continue to be well received in the market with more than million customers enrolled since the plan\'s introduction. In addition, AT&Thas been successful in packaging services in the consumer market by givingcustomers the option of intraLATA service with its One Rate offers. More than of the customers enrolled in One Rate have chosen AT&T as their intraLATAprovider. AT&T\'s any distance New York Local One Rate offer, which combines bothlocal and long distance service, has experienced high customer acceptance. AT&Tended the year with nearly , customers under this plan. In , Consumer Services revenue decreased . billion, or ., ona mid single-digit percentage decline in volumes. The decline reflects theongoing competitive nature of the consumer long distance industry, as well asproduct substitution and market migration away from direct dial andhigher-priced calling-card services to rapidly growing wireless services andlower-priced prepaid-card services.EBITEBITDA EBIT declined . billion, or ., and EBITDA declined . billion,or ., in compared with . The declines in EBIT and EBITDA primarilyreflect the decline in the long distance business, offset somewhat bycost-control initiatives.

The remaining increaseswere due to subscriber growth, reflecting the continued successful execution ofAT&T\'s wireless strategy of targeting and retaining specific customer segments,expanding the national wireless footprint, focusing on digital service, andoffering simple rate plans. In addition, an increase in average monthly revenueper user (ARPU) contributed to the growth.

ARPU in was ., a. increase from . The average monthly subscriber churn rate in was. compared with . in . Average monthly subscriber churn increasedduring as a result of competitive pressures, as well as our efforts toexpand to a broader base of consumer segments served (e.g., prepaid wirelessservices). We expect these factors to continue, which will result in a declinein ARPU.EBITEBITDA In , EBIT improved . billion from a deficit of . billion in. Approximately one-half of the improvement was due to higher pretaxearnings on equity investments and greater gains on sales of businesses andinvestments. These items included higher equity earnings due to a gain recordedrelating to the redemption of our investment in AB Cellular, as well as a gainon transactions associated with our affiliate investments in TeleCorp andTritel, and a gain on the sale of Celumovil in . In , we recorded a gainon the sale of WOOD-TV. Also positively impacting the EBIT growth in was a asset impairment charge of . billion and higher intercompany interestincome in resulting from the AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock offeringproceeds attributed to Wireless Services. The remaining EBIT increase wasprimarily due to increased revenue, partially offset by a related increase inexpenses. In , EBIT declined . billion from . billion in . The EBITdecline was primarily due to the asset impairment charge of approximately. billion and lower gains on sales of businesses and investments ofapproximately . billion. EBITDA, which excludes net earnings (losses) from equity investmentsand other income, increased . billion in to . billion. Approximatelyone-half of the increase was due to the impairment charge and the remainderwas due to increased revenue, partially offset by a related increase inexpenses. In , EBITDA, which excludes net earnings (losses) from equityinvestments and other income, declined . billion to . billion. The declinewas primarily due to the asset impairment charge, partially offset by anincrease in revenue net of related expenses.OTHER ITEMS Capital additions increased . billion in , and increased .billion in . Spending in both years focused on increasing the capacity andquality of our national wireless network. Total assets were . billion as of December , , an increase of. billion, or ., compared with December , . The increase wasprimarily due to increases in licensing costs, goodwill, and property, plant andequipment associated with the acquisitions that closed in . In addition,property, plant and equipment increased as a result of significant capitalexpenditures in . These increases were partially offset by a decrease ininvestments, as Wireless Services previously held equity interests in portionsof wireless properties in the San Francisco Bay area and Los Angeles through ABCellular. These markets were consolidated as of December , .<PAGE>BROADBAND Our Broadband segment offers a variety of services through our cablebroadband network, including traditional analog video and new services such asdigital video service, high-speed data service and broadband telephony service.<TABLE><CAPTION>For the Years Ended December , ---- ---- Dollars in millions<S> <C> <C>Revenue.......................................................................... , ,EBIT.............................................................................

Approximately . billion of the increase in revenue was due to theacquisition of MediaOne in and TCI in . In addition, revenue from newservices (digital video, high-speed data, and broadband telephony) and abasic-cable rate increase contributed approximately . billion to the revenueincrease. At December , , Broadband serviced approximately . millionbasic-cable customers, passing approximately . million homes, compared with. million basic-cable customers, passing approximately . million homes atDecember , . The increase reflects the acquisition of MediaOne. AtDecember , , we provided digital video service to approximately .million customers, high-speed data service to approximately . millioncustomers, and broadband telephony service to approximately , customers.This compares with approximately . million digital-video customers,approximately , high-speed data customers, and nearly , broadbandtelephony customers at the end of .EBITEBITDA EBIT in was a deficit of . billion, an improvement of .billion, or .. This improvement was due to approximately . billion ofhigher gains on sales of businesses and investments, primarily gains on the swap<PAGE>of cable properties with Cox and Comcast and the sale of our investment inLenfest, and . billion lower restructuring charges primarily associated withan in-process research and development charge recorded in connection with the acquisition of TCI. Also contributing to the improvement were lower pretaxlosses from equity investments of . billion, due in part to a . billionimprovement from our investment in Cablevision due to gains from cable-systemsales. These improvements were largely offset by the impact of the acquisitionof MediaOne as well as TCI of approximately . billion and higher expensesassociated with high-speed data and broadband telephony services ofapproximately . billion. EBITDA, which excludes net losses from equity investments and otherincome, was . billion in , an improvement of . billion compared with. This improvement was due to the impact of the MediaOne and TCIacquisitions of . billion and lower restructuring charges of . billion.Higher expenses associated with high-speed data and broadband telephony ofapproximately . billion offset these increases.OTHER ITEMS Capital additions increased . to approximately . billion in ,from . billion in . The increase was due to higher capital expendituresof . billion primarily due to MediaOne, which was almost entirely offset bydecreased contributions to various nonconsolidated investments of . billion.In , spending was largely directed toward cable-distribution systems,focusing on the upgrade of cable plant-assets, as well as equity infusions intovarious investments. Total assets at December , , were . billion compared with. billion at December , . The increase in total assets was primarilydue to the MediaOne acquisition and an increase in property, plant and equipmentas a result of capital expenditures, net of depreciation expense. Theseincreases were partially offset by a decrease in the mark-to-market valuation ofcertain investments.CORPORATE AND OTHER This group reflects the results of corporate staff functions, theelimination of transactions between segments, as well as the results ofinternational operations and ventures and Excite@Home.<TABLE><CAPTION>For the Years Ended December , ---- ---- ---- Dollars in millions<S> <C> <C> <C>Revenue..............................................................

Theinternational operations and ventures revenue decrease was largely due to therevenue impact of businesses contributed to Concert and due to the impact of thedivestment of certain businesses. For , revenue decreased . billion, or .. The decline wasdriven by an increase in the elimination of intercompany revenue and the sale ofAT&T Solutions Customer Care (ASCC) in , partially offset by growth ininternational operations and ventures.EBITEBITDA EBIT and EBITDA deficits in increased . billion and .billion to . billion and . billion, respectively. The increases in thedeficits were largely related to Excite@Home. In , restructuring and othercharges, net of minority interest, were . billion higher primarily due togoodwill impairment charges recorded by Excite@Home and AT&T related toExcite@Home. Other impacts included a charge of approximately . billion forthe fair market value increase of put options held by Comcast and Cox related toExcite@Home, and operating losses from Excite@Home. Partially offsetting thesedeclines were an increase in the pension credit due to a higher pension trustasset base resulting from increased investment returns, and lower expensesassociated with our continued efforts to reduce costs, which aggregatedapproximately . billion. In addition, higher net gains on sales ofinvestments and an increase in interest income increased EBIT and EBITDA byapproximately . billion. In , EBIT and EBITDA deficits improved by . billion and .billion to . billion and . billion, respectively. The improvements weredriven by . billion of lower net restructuring and other charges in compared with , partially offset by lower gains on the sales of businessesand lower interest income, which negatively impacted EBIT and EBITDA by .billion. Additionally, EBIT was impacted by dividends on trust preferredsecurities. In , AT&T recorded a gain on the sale of ASCC.OTHER ITEMS Capital additions increased . billion in . The increase wasdriven by our investment in in NetPhone, Inc.

LMGis also engaged in electronic-retailing services, direct-marketing services,advertising sales relating to programming services, infomercials and transaction<PAGE>processing. Earnings from LMG were . billion in compared with losses of. billion from the date of acquisition through December , . Theincrease was primarily due to gains on dispositions, including gains associatedwith the mergers of various companies that LMG had investments in. Gains wererecorded for the difference between the carrying value of LMG\'s interest in theacquired company and the fair value of securities received in the merger. Inaddition, lower stock compensation expense in compared with contributed to the increase. These were partially offset by impairment chargesrecorded on LMG\'s investments to reflect other than temporary declines in valueand higher losses relating to LMG\'s equity affiliates.LIQUIDITY<TABLE><CAPTION>For the Years Ended December , ---- ---- ---- Dollars in millions<S> <C> <C> <C>CASH FLOW OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS: Provided by operating activities........................... , , , (Used in) provided by investing activities.................

The increase was primarily driven by anincrease in net income excluding the noncash impact of depreciation andamortization, net restructuring and other charges and minority interest income(expense). In , net cash provided by operating activities of continuingoperations increased . billion, primarily due to an increase in net income,excluding the noncash impact of depreciation and amortization, net restructuringand other charges and the impact of earnings and losses from equity investments.This increase was partially offset by higher receivables, due primarily tohigher revenue, and an increase in tax payments from the gain on the saleof UCS. AT&T\'s investing activities resulted in a net use of cash of .billion in , compared with a net use of cash of . billion in .During , AT&T used approximately . billion for acquisitions ofbusinesses, primarily MediaOne, and spent . billion on capital expenditures.During , AT&T spent approximately . billion on capital expenditures,approximately . billion on acquisitions of businesses, primarily AGNS, andcontributed . billion of cash to LMG. During , we received . billionrelated to the sales of businesses, including receivables from UCS, partiallyoffset by capital expenditures of . billion. During , net cash provided by financing activities was .billion, compared with . billion in . In , AT&T received .billion from the AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock offering and borrowed anadditional . billion of short-term debt and . billion of net long-termdebt. These were partially offset by the payment of . billion in dividends.In , AT&T received . billion from the issuance of commercial paper andshort-term debt, . billion from the net issuance of long-term debt and .billion from the issuance of redeemable preferred securities. These sources ofcash were partially offset by the acquisition of treasury shares of . billionand the payment of dividends of . billion. Cash used in financing activitiesin primarily related to repayment of long-term and short-term debt, theacquisition of treasury shares and dividends paid on common stock.<PAGE> At December , , we had current assets of . billion andcurrent liabilities of . billion. A significant portion of the currentliabilities, . billion, relates to short-term notes, the majority of whichwere commercial paper or debt with an original maturity of one year or less. Weexpect that we will retire a portion of the short-term debt with other financingarrangements, including the monetization of publicly-held securities, sales ofcertain non-strategic assets and investments, and securitization of certainaccounts receivable. At December , , we had a current liability of .billion, reflecting our obligation under put options held by Comcast and Cox. InJanuary , Comcast and Cox exercised their rights under the put options andelected to receive AT&T stock in lieu of cash. Since December , , we haveannounced the sale of investments or assets, which will result in gross cashproceeds of approximately . billion. In addition, on February , , weexercised our registration rights in TWE and formally requested TWE to begin theprocess of converting the limited partnership into a corporation with registeredequity securities. We have, however, continued our ongoing discussions with AOLTime Warner for the sale of our stake in TWE. In connection with the planned split-off of AT&T Wireless, we announcedthat we will retain up to . billion in shares of AT&T Wireless, which we willdispose of within six months following the split-off. Also in connection withthe split-off, on March , , AT&T Wireless completed a . billion globalbond offering. AT&T Wireless will ultimately use the proceeds to repay .billion in notes receivable and preferred stock that AT&T Common Stock Groupholds in AT&T Wireless. In addition on March , , AT&T Wireless enteredinto . billion in revolving credit facilities. The facilities include a-day tranche and a -year tranche. The facilities are for general corporatepurposes. Another aspect of our restructuring is the expected sale, in late-,of a new class of stock which will track our Broadband business. AT&T is in a joint venture with Alaska Native Wireless (ANW). AtDecember , , AT&T had committed to fund ANW up to . billion based onthe outcome of FCC license spectrum auction. In January , the auction wascompleted and ANW was the highest bidder on approximately . billion inlicenses. Since the announced restructuring plans to create four new businesses,AT&T\'s debt ratings have been under review by the applicable rating agencies. Asa result of this review, AT&T\'s ratings have been downgraded and continued to beon credit watch with negative outlook. These actions will result in an increasedcost of future borrowings and will limit our access to the capital markets. AT&T is pursuing various measures to reduce its debt level. However,there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on terms thatare acceptable to us. If these efforts cannot be completed successfully, or onterms and within the timeframe contemplated, AT&T\'s financial condition would bematerially adversely affected. Some of these adverse conditions include thecompany\'s ability to pursue acquisitions, make capital expenditures to expandits network and cable plant, or pay dividends. On December , , we entered into a -day, billionrevolving-credit facility syndicated to banks, which was unused at December, . As a result of certain transactions subsequent to December , ,specifically the investment by NTT DoCoMo of . billion for a new class ofAT&T preferred stock, and the . billion AT&T Wireless bond offering, thiscredit facility was reduced to . billion.<PAGE> Also in connection with our restructuring, we have reviewed ourdividend policy as it relates to each of the new businesses. On December ,, we announced that the board of directors reduced AT&T\'s quarterly dividendto . per share, from . per share.RISK MANAGEMENT We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest and foreignexchange rates, as well as changes in equity prices associated with affiliatecompanies. In addition, we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in theprices of securities which we monetized through the issuance of debt. On alimited basis, we use certain derivative financial instruments, includinginterest rate swaps, options, forwards, equity hedges and other derivativecontracts, to manage these risks. We do not use financial instruments fortrading or speculative purposes. All financial instruments are used inaccordance with board-approved policies. We use interest rate swaps to manage the impact of interest ratechanges on earnings and cash flows and also to lower our overall borrowingcosts. We monitor our interest rate risk on the basis of changes in fair value.Assuming a downward shift in interest rates, the fair value of interest rateswaps and the underlying hedged debt would have changed by million and million at December , and , respectively. In , we entered into acombined interest rate, forward contract to hedge foreign-currency-denominateddebt. Assuming a downward shift in both interest rates and the foreigncurrency, the fair value of the contract and the underlying hedged debt wouldhave changed by million. In addition, certain debt is indexed to the marketprices of securities we own. Changes in the market prices of these securitiesresult in changes in the fair value of this debt. Assuming a downward changein the market price of these securities, the fair value of the underlying debtand securities would have decreased by million at December , .Assuming a downward shift in interest rates at December , and ,the fair value of unhedged debt would have increased by . billion and million, respectively. We use forward and option contracts to reduce our exposure to the riskof adverse changes in currency exchange rates. We are subject to foreignexchange risk for foreign-currency-denominated transactions, such as debtissued. In addition, in we were subject to foreign exchange risk related toreimbursements to foreign telephone companies for their portion of the revenuebilled by AT&T for calls placed in the United States to a foreign country. Wemonitor our foreign exchange rate risk on the basis of changes in fair value.Assuming a appreciation in the U.S. dollar at December , and ,the fair value of these contracts would have resulted in additional unrealizedlosses of million and million, respectively. Because these contracts areentered into for hedging purposes, we believe that these losses would be largelyoffset by gains on the underlying firmly committed or anticipated transactions. We use equity hedges to manage our exposure to changes in equity pricesassociated with stock appreciation rights (SARs) of affiliated companies.Assuming a decrease in equity prices of affiliated companies, the fair valueof the equity hedges would have decreased by million and million atDecember , and , respectively. Because these contracts are enteredinto for hedging purposes, we believe that the decrease in fair value would belargely offset by gains on the underlying transaction. In order to determine the changes in fair value of our variousfinancial instruments, we use certain modeling techniques, namely Black-Scholes,for our SARs and equity collars. We apply rate sensitivity changes directly toour interest rate swap transactions and forward rate sensitivity to our foreigncurrency forward contracts.<PAGE> The changes in fair value, as discussed above, assume the occurrence ofcertain adverse market conditions. They do not consider the potential effect offavorable changes in market factors and do not represent projected losses infair value that we expect to incur. Future impacts would be based on actualdevelopments in global financial markets. We do not foresee any significantchanges in the strategies used to manage interest rate risk, foreign currencyrate risk or equity price risk in the near future.FINANCIAL CONDITION<TABLE><CAPTION>At December , ---- ---- Dollars in millions<S> <C> <C>Total assets.................................................................... , ,Total liabilities............................................................... , ,Total shareowners\' equity....................................................... , ,<TABLE> Total assets increased . billion, or ., at December , ,primarily due to the impact of the MediaOne acquisition, which resulted inincreased goodwill, franchise costs, other investments including TWE andVodafone Group plc; and the addition of property, plant and equipment. Property,plant and equipment also increased due to capital expenditures made during theyear, net of depreciation expense and equipment contributed to Concert. Thisequipment contribution, as well as a . billion loan to Concert, and ourinvestment in NetPhone are reflected as an increase to other investments.Additionally, other receivables increased due to Concert. Wireless acquisitions,including the impact of consolidating former equity investments, resulted inincreased licensing costs. Total liabilities at December , , increased . billion, or., primarily due to the impact of the MediaOne acquisition, including debtof MediaOne and borrowings to fund the acquisition, as well as the consolidationof Excite@Home. In addition, total debt increased due to the monetization of ourinvestments in Microsoft Corporation and Comcast. Minority interest increased . billion to . billion, primarilyreflecting the minority interest of our ownership of Excite@Home resulting fromthe consolidation of Excite@Home beginning September , , and the preferredstock outstanding of a MediaOne subsidiary. Total shareowners\' equity was . billion at December , , anincrease of . from December , . This increase was primarily due to theissuance of AT&T common stock for the MediaOne acquisition as well as theissuance of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock. The ratio of total debt to total capital, excluding LMG (debt dividedby total debt and equity, excluding LMG) was . at December , ,compared with . at December , . The equity portion of this calculationincludes convertible trust preferred securities, as well as subsidiaryredeemable preferred stock. The increase was primarily driven by higher debtassociated with the MediaOne merger, largely offset by a higher equity baseassociated with the MediaOne merger and the AT&T Wireless Group tracking stockoffering. The ratio of debt (net of cash) to EBITDA was .X at December ,, compared with .X at December , , reflecting additional debtassociated with the MediaOne merger. Included in debt was approximately .billion of notes, which are exchangeable into or collateralized by securities weown. Excluding this debt, the ratio of net-debt-to-EBITDA at December , ,was .X.<PAGE>NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June , the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issuedStatement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. , ""Accounting forDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."" Among other provisions, itrequires that entities recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilitiesin the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fairvalue. Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of thosederivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative andwhether it qualifies for hedge accounting. The effective date for this standardwas delayed via the issuance of SFAS No. . The effective date for SFAS No. is now for fiscal years beginning after June , , though earlieradoption is encouraged and retroactive application is prohibited. For AT&T, thismeans that the standard must be adopted no later than January , . In June , the FASB issued SFAS No. , ""Accounting for CertainDerivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities"" as an amendment to SFASNo. . This statement provides clarification with regard to certainimplementation issues under SFAS No. on specific types of hedges. On January , , AT&T adopted SFAS No. . We recorded a cumulativeeffect of an accounting change, net of applicable income taxes, of approximately. billion of income, or approximately . per diluted share, primarilyattributable to fair value adjustments of debt instruments, including thoseacquired in conjunction with the MediaOne merger, as well as to our warrantportfolio. In addition, in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. , wereclassified certain investment securities, which support debt that is indexedto those securities, from ""available-for-sale"" to ""trading."" Thisreclassification resulted in the recognition of a charge of . billion (.billion after income taxes), or approximately . per diluted share, which wasrecorded as a reduction of other income. As available-for-sale securities,changes in fair value were previously included within other comprehensive incomeas a component of shareowners\' equity. In addition, LMG recorded a cumulativeeffect of an accounting change, net of applicable income taxes, of approximately. billion of income, or approximately . per share. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. , as amended by SFAS No. ,on AT&T\'s future results of operations is dependent upon the fair values of ourderivatives and related financial instruments and could result in pronouncedquarterly fluctuations in other income in future periods. In September , the FASB issued SFAS No. , ""Accounting forTransfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities- -- a Replacement of FASB Statement No. ."" This statement provides accountingand reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets andextinguishments of liabilities. Under these standards, after a transfer offinancial assets, an entity recognizes the financial and servicing assets itcontrols and the liabilities it has incurred, derecognizes financial assets whencontrol has been surrendered, and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished.This statement provides consistent standards for distinguishing transfers offinancial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings. Thisstatement is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets andextinguishments of liabilities occurring after March , . AT&T does notexpect that the adoption of SFAS No. will have a material impact on AT&T\'sresults of operations, financial position or cash flows.<PAGE>SUBSEQUENT EVENTS On January , , AT&T announced that Cox and Comcast had exercisedtheir rights to sell a combined total of . million shares of Excite@HomeSeries A common stock to AT&T as part of an agreement announced in August to reorganize Excite@Home\'s governance. Cox and Comcast elected to receiveshares of AT&T common stock in exchange for their Excite@Home shares. AT&T iscurrently in discussions to renegotiate the terms of the put options which mayresult in a change to the number of shares of AT&T stock that Cox and Comcastwill receive, as well as the number of Excite@Home shares, if any AT&T receives.There can be no assurances that an agreement will be reached with Cox andComcast. On January , , AT&T and NTT DoCoMo (DoCoMo) finalized anagreement whereby DoCoMo invested approximately . billion for a new class ofAT&T preferred stock, termed DoCoMo Wireless tracking stock, that iseconomically equivalent to million shares of AT&T Wireless Group trackingstock and reflects approximately of the financial performance and economicvalue of AT&T Wireless Group. AT&T allocated . billion of the proceeds toAT&T Wireless Group. Each share of DoCoMo Wireless tracking stock is convertibleat any time into AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock. Upon the conversion of theDoCoMo Wireless tracking stock, AT&T will reduce its portion of the financialperformance and economic value in AT&T Wireless Group by million shares, andthe balance of the million shares will come from the issuance of millionnew shares of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock. Additionally, upon completionof the planned split-off of AT&T Wireless, the DoCoMo Wireless tracking stockand related warrants will automatically be converted into AT&T Wireless Grouptracking stock and thereafter be exchanged on the same terms as all other sharesof AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock in the split-off. In the event that AT&Thas not split-off AT&T Wireless by specified dates beginning January , ,DoCoMo will have the right, at its election, to require AT&T to repurchase fromDoCoMo the preferred shares initially issued to them at DoCoMo\'s originalpurchase price plus interest up to the date of payment. The interest under thisright will be treated as preferred stock dividends with charges recorded as areduction of AT&T Common Stock Group earnings. In addition, DoCoMo acquiredfive-year warrants to purchase the equivalent of an additional . millionshares of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock at per share. As part of theagreement, DoCoMo obtained a seat on AT&T\'s board of directors until AT&TWireless is split-off from AT&T as a separate public company, which is expectedto occur later in . At that time, DoCoMo will retain representation on thenew public AT&T Wireless board. In January , AT&T entered into agreements with certain networkequipment vendors, which extend through , to purchase next-generationwireless network equipment for a total of approximately . billion. On February , , AT&T entered into an agreement with VodafoneGroup plc to sell our stake in Japan Telecom Co. Ltd for approximately .billion in cash.

(AT&T or the company) is among the world\'s communicationsleaders, providing voice, data, video and broadband telecommunications servicesto large and small businesses, consumers and government agencies. We providedomestic and international long distance; regional, local and wirelesscommunications services; cable television and Internet communication services.AT&T also provides billing, directory and calling-card services to support ourcommunications businesses.MERGER WITH MEDIAONE GROUP, INC. We completed the merger with MediaOne Group, Inc. (MediaOne) on June, , in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately billion.We issued approximately million shares, of which million were treasuryshares, and made cash payments of approximately billion. The merger was recorded under the purchase method of accounting, andaccordingly, the results of MediaOne have been included with the financialresults of AT&T, within our Broadband segment, since the date of acquisition.Periods prior to the merger were not restated to include the results ofMediaOne.TRACKING STOCKS On April , , AT&T issued a new class of stock to track theperformance of AT&T Wireless Group. AT&T sold million shares of AT&TWireless Group tracking shares at a price of . per share. The millionshares track approximately of the financial performance of AT&T WirelessGroup. In addition, in connection with the acquisition ofTele-Communications, Inc. (TCI), renamed AT&T Broadband (Broadband), AT&T issueda separate tracking stock to reflect the financial performance of Liberty MediaGroup (LMG), TCI\'s former programming and technology investment businesses. Theoutstanding Liberty Media Group tracking stock tracks of the financialperformance of LMG. The remaining results of operations of AT&T, including approximately of the financial performance of AT&T Wireless Group, are referred to as theAT&T Common Stock Group and are represented by AT&T common stock. A tracking stock is designed to provide financial returns to itsholders based on the financial performance and economic value of the assets ittracks. Ownership of shares of AT&T common stock, AT&T Wireless Group trackingstock or Liberty Media Class A or B tracking stock does not represent a directlegal interest in the assets and liabilities of any of the groups, but anownership of AT&T in total. The specific shares represent an interest in theeconomic performance of the net assets of each of the groups. The earnings attributable to AT&T Wireless Group representapproximately of the earnings from April , , through December ,, and are excluded from the earnings available to AT&T Common Stock Group.Similarly, the earnings and losses related to LMG are excluded from the earningsavailable to AT&T Common Stock Group.<PAGE> We do not have a controlling financial interest in LMG for financialaccounting purposes; therefore, our ownership in LMG is reflected as aninvestment accounted for under the equity method in AT&T\'s consolidatedfinancial statements. The amounts attributable to LMG are reflected in theaccompanying consolidated financial statements as ""Equity earnings (losses) fromLiberty Media Group"" and ""Investment in Liberty Media Group and relatedreceivables, net"". AT&T Wireless Group is an integrated business of AT&T and Liberty MediaGroup is a combination of certain assets and businesses of AT&T, neither ofwhich is a stand-alone entity. As AT&T Wireless Group and Liberty Media Groupare tracking stocks of AT&T, separate financial statements are not required tobe filed. We have provided the financial statements as exhibits to this documentto provide additional disclosures to investors to allow them to assess thefinancial performance of AT&T Wireless Group and Liberty Media Group. Since thetracking stocks are governed by a common board of directors, the AT&T board ofdirectors could make operational and financial decisions or implement policiesthat affect disproportionately the businesses of any group. For example, ourboard of directors may decide to transfer funds or to reallocate assets,liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows among groups, without the consentof shareholders. All actions by the board of directors are subject to the boardmembers\' fiduciary duties to all shareholders of AT&T as a group and not just toholders of a particular class of tracking stock and to our charter, policystatements, by-laws and inter-company agreements. Our board of directors may change or supplement the policies set forthin the tracking stock policy statements and our by-laws in the sole discretionof our board of directors, subject to the provisions of any inter-groupagreement but without approval of our shareholders. In addition, the fact thatwe have separate classes of common stock could give rise to occasions when theinterests of the holders of AT&T common stock, AT&T Wireless Group common stockand Liberty Media Group tracking stock diverge, conflict or appear to diverge orconflict. Our board of directors would make any change or addition to thepolicies set forth in the tracking stock policy statements or our by-laws, andwould respond to any actual or apparent divergence of interest among our groups,in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties to AT&T and all of ourshareholders after giving consideration to the potentially divergent interestsand all other relevant interests of the holders of the separate classes of ourshares. You should consider that as a result of the flexibility provided to ourboard of directors, it may be difficult for investors to assess the futureprospects of a tracking stock group based on that group\'s past performance.RESTRUCTURING OF AT&T On October , , we announced a restructuring plan designed tofully separate or issue separately tracked stocks intended to reflect thefinancial performance and economic value of each of the company\'s four majoroperating units. Upon completion of the plan, AT&T Wireless, AT&T Broadband,AT&T Business and AT&T Consumer will all be represented by asset-based ortracking stocks. As part of the first phase of the restructuring plan, we are planningan exchange offer that will give AT&T shareowners the opportunity to exchangeany portion of their AT&T common shares for shares of AT&T Wireless Grouptracking stock, subject to pro-ration. Following the exchange offer and subjectto specified conditions, AT&T plans to split-off AT&T Wireless Group from AT&T.We intend, however, to retain up to billion of shares of AT&T Wireless forfuture sale, exchange or monetization within six months following the split-off.We expect AT&T Wireless will become an independent, publicly-held company inmid-, upon receipt of appropriate tax and other approvals. In addition to the split-off of AT&T Wireless, we intend to fullyseparate or issue separate tracking stocks to reflect the financial performanceand economic value of each of our other major business units. We plan to createand issue new classes of stock to track the financial performance and economicvalue of our AT&T Broadband unit and AT&T Consumer unit. We plan to sell somepercentage of shares of the AT&T Broadband unit in the fall of . Within months of such sale, we intend to completely separate AT&T Broadband from AT&T,as an asset-based stock. The AT&T Consumer tracking stock is expected to befully distributed to AT&T shareowners in the second half of . AT&T expects that these transactions will be tax-free to U.S.shareholders. AT&T\'s restructuring plan is complicated and involves asubstantial number of steps and transactions, including obtaining variousconditions, such as Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rulings. In addition, futurefinancial conditions, superior alternatives or other factors may arise or occurthat make it inadvisable to proceed with part or all of AT&T\'s restructuringplan. Any or all of the elements of AT&T\'s restructuring plan may not occur aswe currently expect or in the timeframes that we currently contemplate, or atall. Alternative forms of restructuring, including sales of interests in thesebusinesses, would reduce what is available for distribution to shareowners inthe restructuring. On November , , we announced that our board of directors voted tosplit-off LMG. A new asset-based security will be issued to holders of LMGtracking stock in exchange for their LMG tracking shares. The split-off remainssubject to receipt of a favorable tax ruling from the IRS. We expect thissplit-off to be completed in mid-.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This document may contain forward-looking statements with respect toAT&T\'s restructuring plan, financial condition, results of operations, cash<PAGE>flows, dividends, financing plans, business strategies, operating efficienciesor synergies, budgets, capital and other expenditures, network build out andupgrade, competitive positions, availability of capital, growth opportunitiesfor existing products, benefits from new technologies, availability anddeployment of new technologies, plans and objectives of management, and othermatters.

Moreover, in thefuture, AT&T, through its senior management, may make forward-looking statementsabout the matters described in this document or other matters concerning AT&T. The discussion and analysis that follows provides informationmanagement believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of AT&T\'sconsolidated results of operations for the years ended December , , and , and financial condition as of December , and .CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The comparison of results with was impacted by events, suchas acquisitions and dispositions that occurred during these two years. For<PAGE>example, in we acquired MediaOne and wireless properties in the SanFrancisco Bay area, which were both included in our results for part of theyear, but were not in results. In , we acquired TCI, the IBM GlobalNetwork (now AT&T Global Network Services, or AGNS) and Vanguard CellularSystems, Inc. (Vanguard). These businesses were included in results for afull year, but only a part of (since their respective dates ofacquisition). Further, we disposed of certain international businesses during and . The results of businesses sold in were included in results for part of the year, and were not in results. Likewise, businessessold in were included in results for the full year and in resultsfor part of the year. Year-over-year comparison was also impacted by the consolidation of AtHome Corp. (Excite@Home) beginning September , , due tocorporate-governance changes which gave AT&T a controlling interest. At thattime and on December , , we had an approximate economic interest and voting interest in Excite@Home. Prior to September , , we accounted forour ownership in Excite@Home under the equity method of accounting, which meansour investment was included in ""Other investments and related advances"" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and any earnings or losses were included as acomponent of ""Net losses from other equity investments"" in the ConsolidatedStatements of Income. The consolidation of Excite@Home resulted in the inclusionof of its results in each line item of AT&T\'s Consolidated Balance Sheetand Consolidated Income Statement. The approximate we do not own is shown inthe Consolidated Balance Sheet within ""Minority interest"" and as acomponent of ""Minority interest income (expense)"" in the ConsolidatedStatement of Income. On January , , we launched Concert, our global joint venture withBritish Telecommunications plc (BT). AT&T contributed all of its internationalgateway-to-gateway assets and the economic value of approximately multinational customers specifically targeted for direct sales by Concert. As aresult, results do not include the revenue and expenses associated withthese customers and businesses, while does, and results include ourproportionate share of Concert\'s earnings in ""Net losses from other equityinvestments."" Effective July , , the FCC eliminated Primary InterexchangeCarrier Charges (PICC or per-line charges) that AT&T pays for residential andsingle-line business customers. The elimination of these per-line chargesresulted in lower access expense as well as lower revenue, since AT&T hashistorically billed its customers for these charges. The comparison of results with was also impacted by the acquisitions of TCI, AGNS and Vanguard, since results include thesebusinesses for part of the year, while does not include them. Thiscomparison is also impacted by the dispositions of internationalbusinesses, which were included in results for part of the year, but werein results for the full year.<TABLE><CAPTION>For the Years Ended December , ---- ---- ---- Dollars in millions<S> <C> <C> <C>Business Services..................................................... , , ,Consumer Services..................................................... , , ,Wireless Services..................................................... , , ,Broadband............................................................. , , --Other and Corporate...................................................

Approximately . billion of the increase was due to the impactof acquisitions and the consolidation of Excite@Home, offset by the impact ofConcert, dispositions and the elimination of PICC. The remaining . billionincrease was primarily driven by a growing demand for our wireless and data andInternet protocol (IP) products, and outsourcing services, partially offset bycontinued and accelerating declines in long distance voice revenue. We expectlong distance revenue to continue to be negatively impacted by ongoingcompetition and product substitution. Total revenue in increased . billion, or ., compared with. Nearly three-quarters of the increase was due to acquisitions, net ofdispositions. The remaining increase was fueled by growth in wireless, businessdata, business long distance voice and outsourcing revenue, partially offset bythe continued decline of consumer long distance voice revenue. Revenue by segment is discussed in greater detail in the segmentresults section.<TABLE><CAPTION>For the Years Ended December , ---- ---- ---- Dollars in millions<S> <C> <C> <C>Costs of services and products........................................ , , ,<TABLE> Costs of services and products include the costs of operating andmaintaining our networks, costs to support our outsourcing contracts, fees paidto other wireless carriers for the use of their networks (off-network roaming),programming and licensing costs for cable services, costs of wireless handsetssold, the provision for uncollectible receivables and other service-relatedcosts. These costs increased . billion, or ., in compared with. Nearly . billion of the increase was due to acquisitions and the impactof consolidating Excite@Home, net of the impact of Concert and divestments ofinternational businesses. The higher costs associated with our growing wirelesssubscriber base and wireless network as well as new outsourcing contractsincreased expenses by approximately . billion. The higher wireless expensesprimarily related to higher costs of handsets sold, due to a . increase ingross subscriber additions in compared with . Expenses also increaseddue to higher video-programming costs principally due to rate increases, andhigher costs associated with new broadband services of approximately .billion. These increases were partially offset by approximately . billion ofcosts savings from continued cost control initiatives and a higher pensioncredit in , primarily driven by a higher pension trust asset base, resultingfrom increased investment returns. Costs of services and products rose . billion, or ., in compared with , primarily due to acquisitions, net of dispositions, whichaccounted for approximately . billion of the increase. The higher costsassociated with our growing wireless subscriber base as well as new outsourcingcontracts increased expenses by approximately . billion. Partially offsettingthe increases were network cost-control initiatives of approximately .billion, and approximately . billion of lower expenses in Business Servicesrelated to per-call compensation expense, provision for uncollectiblereceivables and gross receipts and property taxes.<PAGE><TABLE><CAPTION>For the Years Ended December , ---- ---- ---- Dollars in millions<S> <C> <C> <C>Access and other connection........................................... , , ,<TABLE> Access and other connection expenses decreased ., to . billionin , compared with . billion in . Included within access and otherconnection expenses are costs that we pay to connect domestic calls on thefacilities of other service providers. Mandated reductions in per-minute accesscosts and decreased per-line charges resulted in lower costs of approximately. billion. Also contributing to the decrease was more efficient networkusage. These decreases were partially offset by approximately . billion ofhigher costs due to volume increases, and . billion as a result of higherUniversal Service Fund contributions. Since most of these charges are passedthrough to the customer, the per-minute access-rate and per-line chargereductions and the increased Universal Service Fund contributions have generallyresulted in a corresponding impact on revenue. Costs paid to telephone companies outside of the United States toconnect calls made to countries outside of the United States (internationalsettlements) are also included within access and other connection expenses.These costs decreased approximately . billion in , as result of thecommencement of operations of Concert. Concert now incurs most of ourinternational settlements as well as earns most of our foreign-billed revenue,previously incurred and earned directly by AT&T. In , Concert billed us anet expense composed of international settlement (interconnection) expense andforeign-billed revenue. The amount charged by Concert in was lower thaninterconnection expense incurred in , since AT&T recorded these transactionsas revenue and expense, as applicable. Partially offsetting the decline werecosts incurred related to Concert products that AT&T now sells to its customers. Access and other connection expenses declined . billion, or ., in compared with the prior year. This decline resulted from . billion ofmandated reductions in per-minute access rates in and , and .billion of lower international settlement rates resulting from our negotiationswith international carriers. Additionally, we continue to manage these coststhrough more efficient network usage. These reductions were partially offset by. billion of higher costs due to volume growth, and . billion as a resultof increased per-line charges and Universal Service Fund contributions.<TABLE><CAPTION>For the Years Ended December , ---- ---- ---- Dollars in millions<S> <C> <C> <C>Selling, general and administrative................................... , , ,<TABLE> Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased .billion, or ., in compared with . Approximately . billion of thedecrease was due to savings from continued cost-control initiatives and a higherpension credit in , primarily driven by a higher pension trust asset base,resulting from increased investment returns. Largely offsetting this decreasewas more than . billion of higher expenses associated with our growingwireless and broadband businesses, and nearly . billion of expensesassociated with acquisitions and the consolidation of Excite@Home, net of theimpact of Concert and dispositions.<PAGE> SG&A expenses increased . billion, or ., in compared with. This increase was primarily due to acquisitions, net of dispositions,which resulted in an increase in SG&A expenses of approximately . billion.Also contributing to the increase was approximately . billion of higher coststo support our growing wireless subscriber base. Partially offsetting theseincreases were our continued efforts to control costs on a companywide basis,which resulted in lower SG&A expenses of approximately . billion, includinglower spending for consumer long distance acquisition-programs.<TABLE><CAPTION>For the Years Ended December , ---- ---- ---- Dollars in millions<S> <C> <C> <C>Depreciation and other amortization....................................... , , ,<TABLE> Depreciation and other amortization expenses rose . billion, or., in compared with and increased . billion, or ., in compared with . Approximately one-half of the increase in both years was dueto acquisitions and the consolidation of Excite@Home, net of dispositions andthe impact of Concert, as applicable. The remaining increase was primarily dueto a higher asset base resulting from continued infrastructure investment.

This increase was largely attributable to the consolidation ofExcite@Home, as well as acquisitions, primarily MediaOne and TCI. Franchisecosts represent the value attributable to agreements with local authorities thatallow access to homes in Broadband\'s service areas. Other purchased intangiblesarising from business combinations primarily included customer relationships andlicenses. Amortization of goodwill, franchise costs and other purchasedintangibles increased . billion in compared with due primarily tothe acquisition of TCI and, to a lesser extent, AGNS. As a result of our evaluation of recent changes in our industry and theviews of regulatory authorities, AT&T expects that the amortization period forall licensing costs, franchise costs, and goodwill associated with newlyacquired wireless, telecommunications, and cable operations will not exceed years.<TABLE><CAPTION>For the Years Ended December , ---- ---- ---- Dollars in millions<S> <C> <C> <C>Net restructuring and other charges....................................... , , ,<TABLE><PAGE> During , we recorded . billion of net restructuring and othercharges, which had an approximate . earnings per diluted share impact to theAT&T Common Stock Group. The charge included . billion of assetimpairment charges related to Excite@Home, million for restructuring andexit costs associated with AT&T\'s initiative to reduce costs, and millionrelated to the government-mandated disposition of AT&T Communications (U.K.)Ltd., which would have competed directly with Concert. The asset impairment charges related to Excite@Home resulted from thedeterioration of the market conditions and market valuations of Internet-relatedcompanies during the fourth quarter of , which caused Excite@Home toconclude that intangible assets related to their acquisitions ofInternet-related companies may not be recoverable. Accordingly, Excite@Homeconducted a detailed assessment of the recoverability of the carrying amounts ofacquired intangible assets. This assessment resulted in a determination thatcertain acquired intangible assets, including goodwill, related to theseacquisitions, including Excite, were impaired as of December , . As aresult, Excite@Home recorded impairment charges of . billion in December, representing the excess of the carrying amount of the impaired assets overtheir fair value. The impairment was allocated to each asset group based on a comparisonof carrying values and fair values. The impairment write-down within each assetgroup was allocated first to goodwill, and if goodwill was reduced to zero, toidentifiable intangible assets in proportion to carrying values. Since we own approximately of Excite@Home, of the chargerecorded by Excite@Home was not included as a reduction to AT&T\'s net income,but rather was eliminated in our Consolidated Statement of Income as""Minority interest income (expense)."" Also as a result of the foregoing, AT&T recorded a goodwill andacquisition-related impairment charge of . billion associated with theacquisition of our investment in Excite@Home. The write-down of our investmentto fair value was determined utilizing discounted expected future cash flows. The million charge for restructuring and exit plans was primarilydue to headcount reductions, mainly in network operations and Business Services,including the consolidation of customer-care and call centers, as well assynergies created by the MediaOne merger. Included in exit costs was million of cash termination benefitsassociated with the separation of approximately , employees as part ofvoluntary and involuntary termination plans. Approximately one-half of theseparations were management employees and one-half were nonmanagement employees.Approximately , employee separations were related to involuntaryterminations and approximately to voluntary terminations. We also recorded million of network lease and other contracttermination costs associated with penalties incurred as part of notifyingvendors of the termination of these contracts during the year, and net losses of million related to the disposition of facilities primarily due to synergiescreated by the MediaOne merger. Also included in restructuring and exit costs in was millionof benefit plan curtailment costs associated with employee separations as partof these exit plans. Further, we recorded an asset impairment charge of million related to the write-down of unrecoverable assets in certain businesseswhere the carrying value was no longer supported by estimated future cash flows.<PAGE> The restructuring initiatives are projected to yield cash savingsof approximately million per year, as well as EBIT (earnings beforeinterest and taxes, including pretax minority interest and net pretax lossesfrom other equity investments) savings of approximately million per year.We expect increased spending in growth businesses will largely offset these cashand EBIT savings. The EBIT savings, primarily attributable to reducedpersonnel-related expenses, will be realized in SG&A expenses and costs ofservices and products. During , we recorded . billion of net restructuring and othercharges, which had an approximate . earnings per diluted share impact to theAT&T Common Stock Group. A million in-process research and development charge was recordedreflecting the estimated fair value of research and development projects at TCI,as of the date of the acquisition, which had not yet reached technologicalfeasibility or had no alternative future use. The projects identified related toefforts to offer voice over IP, product-integration efforts for advanced set-topdevices, cost-savings efforts for broadband-telephony implementation, andin-process research and development related to Excite@Home. We estimated thefair value of in-process research and development for each project using anincome approach, which was adjusted to allocate fair value based on theproject\'s percentage of completion. Under this approach, the present value ofthe anticipated future benefits of the projects was determined using a discountrate of . For each project, the resulting net present value was multiplied bya percentage of completion based on effort expended to date versus projectedcosts to complete. The charge associated with voice-over-IP technology, which allows voicetelephony traffic to be digitized and transmitted in IP data packets, was million as of the date of acquisition. Current voice-over-IP equipment does notyet support many of the features required to connect customer premises equipmentto traditional phone networks. Further technical development is also needed toensure voice quality that is comparable to conventional circuit-switchedtelephony and to reduce the power consumption of the IP-telephony equipment. Westarted testing IP-telephony equipment in the field in late- and willcontinue tests throughout . The charge associated with product-integration efforts for advancedset-top devices, which will enable us to offer next-generation digital services,was million as of the acquisition date. The associated technology consistsof the development and integration work needed to provide a suite of softwaretools to run on the digital set-top box hardware platform. It is anticipatedthat field trials will begin in late- for next-generation digital services. The charge associated with cost-savings efforts for broadband-telephonyimplementation was million as of the date of acquisition. Telephony costreductions primarily consist of cost savings from the development of a ""line ofpower switch,"" which allows us to cost effectively provide power for customertelephony equipment through the cable plant. This device will allow us toprovide line-powered telephony without burying the cable line to each house.Trials related to our telephony cost reductions are complete, and implementationhas begun in certain markets. Additionally, the in-process research and development charge related toExcite@Home was valued at million. This charge related to projects to allowfor self-provisioning of devices and the development of next-generation clientsoftware, network and back-office infrastructure to enable a variety of networkdevices beyond personal computers and improved design for the regional datacenters\' infrastructure.<PAGE> Although there are technological issues to overcome to successfullycomplete the acquired in-process research and development, we expect successfulcompletion. We estimate the costs to complete the identified projects will nothave a material impact on our results of operations. If, however, we are unableto establish technological feasibility and produce commercially viableproductsservices, anticipated incremental future cash flows attributable toexpected profits from such new productsservices may not be realized. A million asset impairment charge was recorded in associatedwith the planned disposal of certain wireless communications equipment resultingfrom a program to increase the capacity and operating efficiency of our wirelessnetwork. As part of a multivendor program, contracts have been executed withselect vendors to replace significant portions of our wireless infrastructureequipment in the western United States and the metropolitan New York markets.The program is intended to provide Wireless Services with the newest technologyavailable and allow us to evolve to new, next-generation digital technology,which is designed to provide high-speed data capabilities. Since the assets willremain in service from the date of the decision to dispose of these assets tothe disposal date, the remaining net book value of the assets will bedepreciated over this period. Also in , a million charge for restructuring and exit costswas recorded as part of AT&T\'s initiative to reduce costs. The restructuring andexit plans primarily focused on the maximization of synergies through headcountreductions in Business Services and network operations, including theconsolidation of customer-care and call centers. Included in exit costs was million of cash termination benefitsassociated with the separation of approximately , employees as part ofvoluntary and involuntary termination plans. Approximately one-half of theseparations were management employees and one-half were nonmanagement employees.Approximately , employee separations were related to involuntaryterminations and approximately , to voluntary terminations. The restructuring initiatives are projected to yield cash savingsof approximately million per year. This restructuring yielded EBIT savingsof approximately million in , and is expected to save nearly million per year thereafter. We expect increased spending in growth businesseswill largely offset these cash and EBIT savings. The EBIT savings, primarilyattributable to reduced personnel-related expenses, will be realized in SG&Aexpenses and costs of services and products. We also recorded net losses of million related to thegovernment-mandated disposition of certain international businesses that wouldhave competed directly with Concert, and million related to a contributionagreement Broadband entered into with Phoenixstar, Inc. That agreement requiresBroadband to satisfy certain liabilities owed by Phoenixstar and itssubsidiaries. The remaining obligation under this contribution agreement and anagreement that MediaOne had is million, which was fully accrued for atDecember , . In addition, we recorded benefits of million related tothe settlement of pension obligations for former employees who accepted AT&T\'s voluntary retirement incentive program (VRIP) offer. During , we recorded . billion of net restructuring and othercharges, which had an approximate . earnings per diluted share impact to theAT&T Common Stock Group. The bulk of the charge was associated with our overallcost-reduction program and the approximately , management employees whoaccepted the VRIP offer. A restructuring charge of , million was composed<PAGE>of , million and million for pension and postretirementspecial-termination benefits, respectively, million of benefit plancurtailment losses and million of other administrative costs. We alsorecorded charges of million for related facility costs and million forexecutive-separation costs. These charges were partially offset by benefits of million as we settled pension benefit obligations for , of the totalVRIP employees. In addition, the VRIP charges were partially offset by thereversal of million of business restructuring reserves primarilyresulting from the overlap of VRIP on certain projects. Also included in the net restructuring and other charges wereasset impairment charges totaling million, of which million wasrelated to our decision not to pursue Total Service Resale (TSR) as alocal-service strategy. We also recorded an million asset impairment chargerelated to the write-down of unrecoverable assets in certain internationaloperations where the carrying value was no longer supported by future cashflows. This charge was made in connection with the review of certain operationsthat would have competed directly with Concert. Additionally, million of merger-related expenses were recorded in in connection with the Teleport Communications Group Inc. (TCG) merger,which was accounted for as a pooling of interests. Partially offsetting thesecharges was a million reversal of the restructuring reserve. Thisreversal reflected reserves no longer deemed necessary. The reversal primarilyincluded separation costs attributed to projects completed at a cost lower thanoriginally anticipated. Consistent with the three-year plan, the restructuring initiatives were substantially completed by the end of .<TABLE><CAPTION>For the Years Ended December , ---- ---- ---- Dollars in millions<S> <C> <C> <C>Operating income......................................................... , , ,<TABLE> Operating income decreased . billion, or ., in comparedwith . The decrease was primarily due to higher net restructuring and othercharges of . billion. Also contributing to the decrease was the impact of theacquisition of MediaOne and the consolidation of Excite@Home, which loweredoperating income by . billion. A majority of the impact of operating lossesand the restructuring charge generated by Excite@Home was offset in minorityinterest income (expense), reflecting the approximate of Excite@Home we donot own. Partially offsetting these decreases were cost-control initiatives anda larger pension credit associated with our mature long distance businesses andrelated support groups, partially offset by lower long distance revenue.

Accordingly, the revenue, costs and expenses,and cash flows of UCS have been excluded from the respective captions in the Consolidated Statement of Income and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows,and have been reported through the April , date of disposition as ""Incomefrom discontinued operations,"" net of applicable income taxes; and as ""Net cashprovided by discontinued operations."" The gain associated with the sale of UCSis recorded as ""Gain on sale of discontinued operations,"" net of applicableincome taxes.Extraordinary Items In August , AT&T extinguished approximately . billion of TCG\'sdebt. The million pretax loss on the early extinguishment of debt wasrecorded as an extraordinary loss. The after-tax impact was million, or. per diluted share.SEGMENT RESULTS In support of the services we provided in , we segment our resultsby the business units that support our primary lines of business: BusinessServices, Consumer Services, Wireless Services and Broadband. The balance ofAT&T\'s operations, excluding LMG, is included in a Corporate and Other category.Although not a segment, we also discuss the results of LMG. The discussion of segment results includes revenue; EBIT (earningsbefore interest and taxes, including pretax minority interest and net pretaxlosses of other equity investments); EBITDA (EBIT plus depreciation,amortization and minority interest income (expense) other than Excite@Home);total assets, and capital additions. The discussion of EBITDA for WirelessServices and Broadband is modified to exclude other income and net losses fromequity investments. Total assets for each segment generally include all assets,except intercompany receivables. However, our Wireless Services segment includedintercompany receivables from AT&T and the related interest income since theseassets relate to the results of the AT&T Wireless Group tracked business.Prepaid pension assets and corporate-owned or leased real estate are generallyheld at the corporate level, and therefore are included in the Corporate andOther group. Shared network assets are allocated to the segments and reallocatedeach January, based on two years of volumes. Capital additions for each segmentinclude capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment, acquisitions oflicenses, additions to nonconsolidated investments, increases in franchise costsand additions to internal-use software.<PAGE> EBIT is the primary measure used by AT&T\'s chief operating decisionmakers to measure AT&T\'s operating results and to measure segment profitabilityand performance. AT&T calculates EBIT as operating income plus net pretax lossesfrom equity investments, pretax minority interest income (expense) and otherincome. In addition, management also uses EBITDA as a measure of segmentprofitability and performance, and is defined as EBIT, excluding minorityinterest income (expense) other than Excite@Home, plus depreciation andamortization. Interest and taxes are not factored into the segment profitabilitymeasure used by the chief operating decision makers; therefore, trends for theseitems are discussed on a consolidated basis. Management believes EBIT ismeaningful to investors because it provides analysis of operating results usingthe same measures used by AT&T\'s chief operating decision makers and provides areturn on total capitalization measure. We believe EBITDA is meaningful toinvestors as a measure of each segment\'s liquidity consistent with the measureutilized by our chief operating decision makers. In addition, we believe thatboth EBIT and EBITDA allow investors a means to evaluate the financial resultsof each segment in relation to total AT&T. EBIT for AT&T was . billion, .billion and . billion for the years ended December , , and ,respectively. EBITDA for AT&T was . billion, . billion and . billionfor the years ended December , , and , respectively. Ourcalculation of EBIT and EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculationof these measures by other public companies. EBIT and EBITDA should not beviewed by investors as an alternative to generally accepted accountingprinciples (GAAP) measures of income as a measure of performance or to cashflows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure ofliquidity. In addition, EBITDA does not take into account changes in certainassets and liabilities as well as interest and taxes which can affect cash flow. Reflecting the dynamics of our business, we continually review ourmanagement model and structure and make adjustments accordingly.BUSINESS SERVICES Our Business Services segment offers a variety of global communicationsservices, including long distance, local, and data and IP networking to smalland medium-sized businesses, large domestic and multinational businesses andgovernment agencies. Business Services is also a provider of voice, data and IPtransport to service resellers (wholesale services).

Approximately . billion of the increase was due to the impact ofacquisitions, partially offset by the formation of Concert. Strength in data andIP services as well as growth in our outsourcing business contributed .billion to the increase. This growth, however, was offset by an approximate .billion decline in long distance voice services as a result of continued pricingpressures in the industry. Revenue in grew . billion, or .. The acquisition of AGNScontributed approximately . billion to the growth. Data, IP and outsourcingservices grew approximately . billion in compared with , while longdistance voice services and local services contributed approximately .billion to the revenue increase. Data services, which represent the transportation of data, rather thanvoice, along our network, was impacted by acquisitions and the formation ofConcert. Excluding these impacts, data services grew at a high-teens percentagerate in . Growth was led by the continued strength of frame relay services;IP services, which include IP-connectivity services and virtual private network(VPN) services; and high-speed private-line services. Excluding the impact ofAGNS, data services grew at a high-teens percentage rate in , led bystrength in frame relay and high-speed private-line services. AT&T Solutions outsourcing revenue grew . in and . in. More than one-half of the growth and approximately of the growth was driven by our acquisition of AGNS. The remaining growth in both yearswas primarily due to growth from new contract signings and add-on business fromexisting clients. Excluding the impact of Concert, long distance voice services revenuedeclined at a mid single-digit percentage rate in due to a decliningaverage price per minute reflecting the competitive forces within the industrywhich are expected to continue. Partially offsetting this decline was a highsingle-digit percentage growth rate in minutes. In , long distance voicerevenue grew at a low single-digit percentage rate, as volumes grew at ahigh-teens percentage rate, which was largely offset by a declining average rateper minute. Local voice services revenue grew nearly in and more than in . During , AT&T added more than , access lines, with the totalreaching nearly . million at the end of the year.

Business Services internal revenue increased million, or ., in and million, or ., in . The increase in was the result ofgreater sales of business long distance services to other AT&T units that resellsuch services to their external customers, primarily Broadband and WirelessServices. The increase in was partially offset by a decline in salesrelated to international businesses divested. In , the increase in internalrevenue was primarily due to greater sales of long distance services to WirelessServices.<PAGE>EBITEBITDA EBIT improved . billion, or ., and EBITDA improved . billion,or ., in compared with . This improvement reflects an increase inrevenue and lower costs as a result of our continued cost-control efforts,partially offset by the formation of Concert and the acquisition of AGNS.Additionally, the EBIT increase was partially offset by an increase indepreciation and amortization expense in compared with primarily dueto a higher network asset base. In , EBIT improved . billion, or ., and EBITDA improved .billion, or ., compared with . These increases were driven by revenuegrowth combined with margin improvement resulting from ongoing cost-controlinitiatives. The increase in EBIT was offset somewhat by increased depreciationand amortization expenses resulting from increased capital expenditures aimed atdata, IP and local services.OTHER ITEMS Capital additions decreased . billion in , and increased .billion in . In , the decrease was a result of lower spending for ourlong distance network (including the data network). In , the increase wasprimarily due to additional spending for the build out of our local servicesSONET transport network. Total assets increased . billion, or ., at December , ,compared with December , . The increase was primarily due to net increasesin property, plant and equipment as a result of capital additions, and a higheraccounts receivable balance.CONSUMER SERVICES Our Consumer Services segment provides residential customers with avariety of any-distance communications services, including long distance, localtoll (intrastate calls outside the immediate local area) and Internet access. Inaddition, Consumer Services provides transaction services, such as prepaidcalling card and operator-handled calling services. Local phone service is alsoprovided in certain areas.<TABLE><CAPTION>For the Years Ended December , ---- ---- ---- Dollars in millions<S> <C> <C> <C>Revenue............................................................... , , ,EBIT.................................................................. , , ,EBITDA................................................................ , , ,Capital additions..................................................... At December , ---- ----Total assets.......................................................... , ,<TABLE><PAGE>REVENUE Consumer Services revenue declined ., or . billion, in compared with . Approximately . billion of the decline was due to theelimination of per-line charges in and the impact of Concert. The remainderof the decline was primarily due to a decline in traditional voice services,such as Domestic Dial , reflecting the ongoing competitive nature of theconsumer long distance industry, which has resulted in pricing pressures and aloss of market share. Also negatively impacting revenue was product substitutionand market migration away from direct-dial wireline and higher-pricedcalling-card services to the rapidly growing wireless services and lower-pricedprepaid-card services. As a result, calling volumes declined at a midsingle-digit percentage rate in . We expect competition and productsubstitution to continue to negatively impact Consumer Services revenue. In August , we introduced AT&T One Rate, which allows customers tomake long distance calls, hours a day, seven days a week, for the same rate.These One Rate offers continue to be well received in the market with more than million customers enrolled since the plan\'s introduction. In addition, AT&Thas been successful in packaging services in the consumer market by givingcustomers the option of intraLATA service with its One Rate offers. More than of the customers enrolled in One Rate have chosen AT&T as their intraLATAprovider. AT&T\'s any distance New York Local One Rate offer, which combines bothlocal and long distance service, has experienced high customer acceptance. AT&Tended the year with nearly , customers under this plan. In , Consumer Services revenue decreased . billion, or ., ona mid single-digit percentage decline in volumes. The decline reflects theongoing competitive nature of the consumer long distance industry, as well asproduct substitution and market migration away from direct dial andhigher-priced calling-card services to rapidly growing wireless services andlower-priced prepaid-card services.EBITEBITDA EBIT declined . billion, or ., and EBITDA declined . billion,or ., in compared with . The declines in EBIT and EBITDA primarilyreflect the decline in the long distance business, offset somewhat bycost-control initiatives.

We expect these factors to continue, which will result in a declinein ARPU.EBITEBITDA In , EBIT improved . billion from a deficit of . billion in. Approximately one-half of the improvement was due to higher pretaxearnings on equity investments and greater gains on sales of businesses andinvestments. These items included higher equity earnings due to a gain recordedrelating to the redemption of our investment in AB Cellular, as well as a gainon transactions associated with our affiliate investments in TeleCorp andTritel, and a gain on the sale of Celumovil in . In , we recorded a gainon the sale of WOOD-TV. Also positively impacting the EBIT growth in was a asset impairment charge of . billion and higher intercompany interestincome in resulting from the AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock offeringproceeds attributed to Wireless Services. The remaining EBIT increase wasprimarily due to increased revenue, partially offset by a related increase inexpenses. In , EBIT declined . billion from . billion in .

In , EBITDA, which excludes net earnings (losses) from equityinvestments and other income, declined . billion to . billion. The declinewas primarily due to the asset impairment charge, partially offset by anincrease in revenue net of related expenses.OTHER ITEMS Capital additions increased . billion in , and increased .billion in . Spending in both years focused on increasing the capacity andquality of our national wireless network. Total assets were . billion as of December , , an increase of. billion, or ., compared with December , . The increase wasprimarily due to increases in licensing costs, goodwill, and property, plant andequipment associated with the acquisitions that closed in . In addition,property, plant and equipment increased as a result of significant capitalexpenditures in . These increases were partially offset by a decrease ininvestments, as Wireless Services previously held equity interests in portionsof wireless properties in the San Francisco Bay area and Los Angeles through ABCellular. These markets were consolidated as of December , .<PAGE>BROADBAND Our Broadband segment offers a variety of services through our cablebroadband network, including traditional analog video and new services such asdigital video service, high-speed data service and broadband telephony service.<TABLE><CAPTION>For the Years Ended December , ---- ---- Dollars in millions<S> <C> <C>Revenue.......................................................................... , ,EBIT.............................................................................

In , AT&T received .billion from the AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock offering and borrowed anadditional . billion of short-term debt and . billion of net long-termdebt. These were partially offset by the payment of . billion in dividends.In , AT&T received . billion from the issuance of commercial paper andshort-term debt, . billion from the net issuance of long-term debt and .billion from the issuance of redeemable preferred securities. These sources ofcash were partially offset by the acquisition of treasury shares of . billionand the payment of dividends of . billion. Cash used in financing activitiesin primarily related to repayment of long-term and short-term debt, theacquisition of treasury shares and dividends paid on common stock.<PAGE> At December , , we had current assets of . billion andcurrent liabilities of . billion. A significant portion of the currentliabilities, . billion, relates to short-term notes, the majority of whichwere commercial paper or debt with an original maturity of one year or less. Weexpect that we will retire a portion of the short-term debt with other financingarrangements, including the monetization of publicly-held securities, sales ofcertain non-strategic assets and investments, and securitization of certainaccounts receivable. At December , , we had a current liability of .billion, reflecting our obligation under put options held by Comcast and Cox. InJanuary , Comcast and Cox exercised their rights under the put options andelected to receive AT&T stock in lieu of cash. Since December , , we haveannounced the sale of investments or assets, which will result in gross cashproceeds of approximately . billion. In addition, on February , , weexercised our registration rights in TWE and formally requested TWE to begin theprocess of converting the limited partnership into a corporation with registeredequity securities. We have, however, continued our ongoing discussions with AOLTime Warner for the sale of our stake in TWE. In connection with the planned split-off of AT&T Wireless, we announcedthat we will retain up to . billion in shares of AT&T Wireless, which we willdispose of within six months following the split-off. Also in connection withthe split-off, on March , , AT&T Wireless completed a . billion globalbond offering. AT&T Wireless will ultimately use the proceeds to repay .billion in notes receivable and preferred stock that AT&T Common Stock Groupholds in AT&T Wireless. In addition on March , , AT&T Wireless enteredinto . billion in revolving credit facilities. The facilities include a-day tranche and a -year tranche. The facilities are for general corporatepurposes. Another aspect of our restructuring is the expected sale, in late-,of a new class of stock which will track our Broadband business. AT&T is in a joint venture with Alaska Native Wireless (ANW). AtDecember , , AT&T had committed to fund ANW up to . billion based onthe outcome of FCC license spectrum auction. In January , the auction wascompleted and ANW was the highest bidder on approximately . billion inlicenses. Since the announced restructuring plans to create four new businesses,AT&T\'s debt ratings have been under review by the applicable rating agencies. Asa result of this review, AT&T\'s ratings have been downgraded and continued to beon credit watch with negative outlook. These actions will result in an increasedcost of future borrowings and will limit our access to the capital markets. AT&T is pursuing various measures to reduce its debt level. However,there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on terms thatare acceptable to us. If these efforts cannot be completed successfully, or onterms and within the timeframe contemplated, AT&T\'s financial condition would bematerially adversely affected. Some of these adverse conditions include thecompany\'s ability to pursue acquisitions, make capital expenditures to expandits network and cable plant, or pay dividends. On December , , we entered into a -day, billionrevolving-credit facility syndicated to banks, which was unused at December, . As a result of certain transactions subsequent to December , ,specifically the investment by NTT DoCoMo of . billion for a new class ofAT&T preferred stock, and the . billion AT&T Wireless bond offering, thiscredit facility was reduced to . billion.<PAGE> Also in connection with our restructuring, we have reviewed ourdividend policy as it relates to each of the new businesses. On December ,, we announced that the board of directors reduced AT&T\'s quarterly dividendto . per share, from . per share. Our board of directors has the power to make determinations that mayimpact the financial and liquidity position of each of the tracking stockgroups. This power includes the ability to set priorities for use of capital anddebt capacity, to determine cash management policies and to make decisionsregarding whether to make capital expenditures and as to the timing and amountof any capital expenditures. All actions by the board of directors are subjectto the board members fiduciary duties to all shareholders of AT&T as a group andnot just to holders of a particular class of tracking stock and to our policystatements, by-laws and inter-company agreements.

In addition, we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in theprices of securities which we monetized through the issuance of debt. On alimited basis, we use certain derivative financial instruments, includinginterest rate swaps, options, forwards, equity hedges and other derivativecontracts, to manage these risks. We do not use financial instruments fortrading or speculative purposes. All financial instruments are used inaccordance with board-approved policies. We use interest rate swaps to manage the impact of interest ratechanges on earnings and cash flows and also to lower our overall borrowingcosts. We monitor our interest rate risk on the basis of changes in fair value.Assuming a downward shift in interest rates, the fair value of interest rateswaps and the underlying hedged debt would have changed by million and million at December , and , respectively. In , we entered into acombined interest rate, forward contract to hedge foreign-currency-denominateddebt. Assuming a downward shift in both interest rates and the foreigncurrency, the fair value of the contract and the underlying hedged debt wouldhave changed by million. In addition, certain debt is indexed to the marketprices of securities we own. Changes in the market prices of these securitiesresult in changes in the fair value of this debt. Assuming a downward changein the market price of these securities, the fair value of the underlying debtand securities would have decreased by million at December , .Assuming a downward shift in interest rates at December , and ,the fair value of unhedged debt would have increased by . billion and million, respectively. We use forward and option contracts to reduce our exposure to the riskof adverse changes in currency exchange rates. We are subject to foreignexchange risk for foreign-currency-denominated transactions, such as debtissued. In addition, in we were subject to foreign exchange risk related toreimbursements to foreign telephone companies for their portion of the revenuebilled by AT&T for calls placed in the United States to a foreign country. Wemonitor our foreign exchange rate risk on the basis of changes in fair value.Assuming a appreciation in the U.S. dollar at December , and ,the fair value of these contracts would have resulted in additional unrealizedlosses of million and million, respectively. Because these contracts areentered into for hedging purposes, we believe that these losses would be largelyoffset by gains on the underlying firmly committed or anticipated transactions. We use equity hedges to manage our exposure to changes in equity pricesassociated with stock appreciation rights (SARs) of affiliated companies.Assuming a decrease in equity prices of affiliated companies, the fair valueof the equity hedges would have decreased by million and million atDecember , and , respectively. Because these contracts are enteredinto for hedging purposes, we believe that the decrease in fair value would belargely offset by gains on the underlying transaction. In order to determine the changes in fair value of our variousfinancial instruments, we use certain modeling techniques, namely Black-Scholes,for our SARs and equity collars. We apply rate sensitivity changes directly toour interest rate swap transactions and forward rate sensitivity to our foreigncurrency forward contracts.<PAGE> The changes in fair value, as discussed above, assume the occurrence ofcertain adverse market conditions. They do not consider the potential effect offavorable changes in market factors and do not represent projected losses infair value that we expect to incur. Future impacts would be based on actualdevelopments in global financial markets. We do not foresee any significantchanges in the strategies used to manage interest rate risk, foreign currencyrate risk or equity price risk in the near future.FINANCIAL CONDITION<TABLE><CAPTION>At December , ---- ---- Dollars in millions<S> <C> <C>Total assets.................................................................... , ,Total liabilities............................................................... , ,Total shareowners\' equity....................................................... , ,<TABLE> Total assets increased . billion, or ., at December , ,primarily due to the impact of the MediaOne acquisition, which resulted inincreased goodwill, franchise costs, other investments including TWE andVodafone Group plc; and the addition of property, plant and equipment. Property,plant and equipment also increased due to capital expenditures made during theyear, net of depreciation expense and equipment contributed to Concert. Thisequipment contribution, as well as a . billion loan to Concert, and ourinvestment in NetPhone are reflected as an increase to other investments.Additionally, other receivables increased due to Concert. Wireless acquisitions,including the impact of consolidating former equity investments, resulted inincreased licensing costs. Total liabilities at December , , increased . billion, or., primarily due to the impact of the MediaOne acquisition, including debtof MediaOne and borrowings to fund the acquisition, as well as the consolidationof Excite@Home. In addition, total debt increased due to the monetization of ourinvestments in Microsoft Corporation and Comcast. Minority interest increased . billion to . billion, primarilyreflecting the minority interest of our ownership of Excite@Home resulting fromthe consolidation of Excite@Home beginning September , , and the preferredstock outstanding of a MediaOne subsidiary. Total shareowners\' equity was . billion at December , , anincrease of . from December , . This increase was primarily due to theissuance of AT&T common stock for the MediaOne acquisition as well as theissuance of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock. The ratio of total debt to total capital, excluding LMG (debt dividedby total debt and equity, excluding LMG) was . at December , ,compared with . at December , . The equity portion of this calculationincludes convertible trust preferred securities, as well as subsidiaryredeemable preferred stock. The increase was primarily driven by higher debtassociated with the MediaOne merger, largely offset by a higher equity baseassociated with the MediaOne merger and the AT&T Wireless Group tracking stockoffering. The ratio of debt (net of cash) to EBITDA was .X at December ,, compared with .X at December , , reflecting additional debtassociated with the MediaOne merger. Included in debt was approximately .billion of notes, which are exchangeable into or collateralized by securities weown. Excluding this debt, the ratio of net-debt-to-EBITDA at December , ,was .X.<PAGE>NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June , the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issuedStatement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. , ""Accounting forDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."" Among other provisions, itrequires that entities recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilitiesin the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fairvalue. Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of thosederivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative andwhether it qualifies for hedge accounting. The effective date for this standardwas delayed via the issuance of SFAS No. . The effective date for SFAS No. is now for fiscal years beginning after June , , though earlieradoption is encouraged and retroactive application is prohibited. For AT&T, thismeans that the standard must be adopted no later than January , . In June , the FASB issued SFAS No. , ""Accounting for CertainDerivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities"" as an amendment to SFASNo. . This statement provides clarification with regard to certainimplementation issues under SFAS No. on specific types of hedges. On January , , AT&T adopted SFAS No. . We recorded a cumulativeeffect of an accounting change, net of applicable income taxes, of approximately. billion of income, or approximately . per diluted share, primarilyattributable to fair value adjustments of debt instruments, including thoseacquired in conjunction with the MediaOne merger, as well as to our warrantportfolio. In addition, in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. , wereclassified certain investment securities, which support debt that is indexedto those securities, from ""available-for-sale"" to ""trading."" Thisreclassification resulted in the recognition of a charge of . billion (.billion after income taxes), or approximately . per diluted share, which wasrecorded as a reduction of other income. As available-for-sale securities,changes in fair value were previously included within other comprehensive incomeas a component of shareowners\' equity. In addition, LMG recorded a cumulativeeffect of an accounting change, net of applicable income taxes, of approximately. billion of income, or approximately . per share. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. , as amended by SFAS No. ,on AT&T\'s future results of operations is dependent upon the fair values of ourderivatives and related financial instruments and could result in pronouncedquarterly fluctuations in other income in future periods. In September , the FASB issued SFAS No. , ""Accounting forTransfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities- -- a Replacement of FASB Statement No. ."" This statement provides accountingand reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets andextinguishments of liabilities. Under these standards, after a transfer offinancial assets, an entity recognizes the financial and servicing assets itcontrols and the liabilities it has incurred, derecognizes financial assets whencontrol has been surrendered, and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished.This statement provides consistent standards for distinguishing transfers offinancial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings. Thisstatement is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets andextinguishments of liabilities occurring after March , . AT&T does notexpect that the adoption of SFAS No. will have a material impact on AT&T\'sresults of operations, financial position or cash flows.<PAGE>SUBSEQUENT EVENTS On January , , AT&T announced that Cox and Comcast had exercisedtheir rights to sell a combined total of . million shares of Excite@HomeSeries A common stock to AT&T as part of an agreement announced in August to reorganize Excite@Home\'s governance.

As AT&T Wireless Group is a tracking stock of AT&T, separatefinancial statements are not required to be filed. We have provided thefinancial statements as an exhibit to this document to provide additionaldisclosures to investors to allow them to assess the financial performance ofAT&T Wireless Group. Since the tracking stocks are governed by a common board ofdirectors, the AT&T board of directors could make operational and financialdecisions or implement policies that affect disproportionately the businesses ofany group. For example, our board of directors may decide to transfer funds orto reallocate assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows amonggroups, without the consent of shareholders. All actions by the board ofdirectors are subject to the board members\' fiduciary duties to all shareholdersof AT&T as a group and not just to holders of a particular class of trackingstock and to our charter, policy statements, by-laws and inter-companyagreements. Our board of directors may change or supplement the policies set forthin the tracking stock policy statements and our by-laws in the sole discretionof our board of directors, subject to the provisions of any inter-groupagreement but without approval of our shareholders. In addition, the fact thatwe have separate classes of common stock could give rise to occasions when theinterests of the holders of AT&T common stock, AT&T Wireless Group common stockand Liberty Media Group tracking stock diverge, conflict or appear to diverge orconflict. Our board of directors would make any change or addition to thepolicies set forth in the tracking stock policy statements or our by-laws, andwould respond to any actual or apparent divergence of interest among our groups,in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties to AT&T and all of ourshareholders after giving consideration to the potentially divergent interestsand all other relevant interests of the holders of the separate classes of ourshares. You should consider that as a result of the flexibility provided to ourboard of directors, it may be difficult for investors to assess the futureprospects of a tracking stock group based on that group\'s past performance.

AT&T WIRELESS GROUP LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The continued expansion of AT&T Wireless Group\'s network and footprint, including spectrum auctions, and service offerings, and the marketing and distribution of its products and services, will continue to require substantial capital. AT&T Wireless Group has funded its operations by offering proceeds attributed from AT&T, intercompany borrowings from AT&T and internally generated funds, as well as capital contributions from AT&T prior to the offering. Capital contributions from AT&T prior to the offering included acquisitions made by AT&T that have been attributed to AT&T Wireless Group. Noncash capital contributions from AT&T to AT&T Wireless Group related to acquisitions and initial investments funded by AT&T totaled million, , million, and million for the years ended December , , , and , respectively. The April offering of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock resulted in net proceeds to AT&T after deducting underwriter\'s discount and related fees and expenses of . billion. AT&T attributed . billion of the net proceeds to AT&T Wireless Group in the form of an intercompany note receivable, which was repaid by December , , and was used primarily to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. On May , , following the offering, AT&T Wireless Group recapitalized . billion of outstanding intercompany indebtedness to AT&T into an additional . billion of cumulative preferred stock held by AT&T. In conjunction with the recapitalization, AT&T Wireless Group\'s long-term debt due to AT&T was recapitalized to be year term debt that bears interest at a fixed rate of . per annum. Currently, financing activities for AT&T Wireless Group are managed by AT&T on a centralized basis and are subject to the review of AT&T Wireless Group\'s capital stock committee. AT&T Wireless Group capital stock committee is selected by AT&T\'s board of directors to oversee the interaction between businesses of AT&T Common Stock Group and AT&T Wireless Group in accordance with the AT&T Wireless Group Policy Statement. Under the AT&T Wireless Group Policy Statement, all material transactions between AT&T Common Stock Group and AT&T Wireless Group are determined and governed by a process of fair dealing. Sources for AT&T Wireless Group\'s future financing requirements may include the borrowing of funds, including additional short-term floating rate debt from AT&T andor third-party debt. Loans from AT&T to any member of AT&T Wireless Group have been made at interest rates and on other terms and conditions intended to be substantially equivalent to the interest rates and other terms and conditions that AT&T Wireless Group would be able to obtain from third parties, including the public markets, as a non-affiliate of AT&T without the benefit of any guaranty by AT&T. This policy contemplates that these loans will be made on the basis set forth above regardless of the interest rates and other terms and conditions on which AT&T may have acquired the funds. If, however, AT&T incurs any fees or charges in order to keep available funds for use by AT&T Wireless Group, those fees or charges will be allocated to AT&T Wireless Group.<PAGE> Our board of directors has the power to make determinations that may impact the financial and liquidity position of each of the tracking stock groups. This power includes the ability to set priorities for use of capital and debt capacity, to determine cash management policies and to make decisions regarding whether to make capital expenditures and as to the timing and amount of any capital expenditures. All actions by the board of directors are subject to the board members fiduciary duties to all shareholders of AT&T as a group and not just to holders of a particular class of tracking stock and to our policy statements, by-laws and inter-company agreements. As a result of this discretion of our board of directors, it may be difficult for investors to assess each group\'s liquidity and capital resource needs and in turn the future prospects of each group based on past performance. In association with the intended split-off of AT&T Wireless Group from AT&T announced on October , , AT&T and AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. anticipate that they will enter into a separation and distribution agreement that will govern the terms of the split-off. As part of this agreement, AT&T Wireless Services will agree, upon completion of the split-off, to repay the full amount of the principal and accrued but unpaid interest or face value and accrued but unpaid dividends, of all outstanding indebtedness owned by AT&T Wireless Group to AT&T, and all preferred stock in AT&T Wireless Group held by AT&T.

AT&T WIRELESS GROUP RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In September , the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. , ""Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities--A Replacement of FASB No. "". This statement provides accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities. Under these standards, after a transfer of financial assets, an entity recognizes the financial and servicing assets it controls and the liabilities it has incurred, derecognizes financial assets when control has been surrendered, and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished. This statement provides consistent standards for distinguishing transfers of financial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings. This statement is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after March , . AT&T Wireless Group does not expect that the adoption of SFAS No. will have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In June , the FASB issued SFAS No. , ""Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities"". Among other provisions, it requires that entities recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. The effective date of this standard was delayed via the issuance of SFAS No. . The effective date for SFAS No. is now for fiscal years beginning after June , , though earlier adoption is encouraged and retroactive application is prohibited. For AT&T Wireless Group, this means that the standard must be adopted no later than January , . In June , the FASB issued SFAS No. , ""Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities"" as an amendment to SFAS No. . This statement provides clarification with regard to certain<PAGE> implementation issues under SFAS No. on specific types of hedges. The adoption of SFAS No. in January , did not have a material impact to the AT&T Wireless Group\'s results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In addition, based on the types of contracts we currently have, AT&T Wireless Group does not anticipate that this standard will have a material impact on future results of AT&T Wireless Group. AT&T WIRELESS GROUP SUBSEQUENT EVENTS In January , AT&T Wireless Group executed agreements with certain network equipment vendors, related to the development of its next-generation network strategy. These agreements require AT&T Wireless Group to buy equipment from these vendors totaling approximately . billion through .

OVERVIEW Ames changed its fiscal year from the last Saturday in January to theSaturday nearest January , effective with the fiscal year ended January ,, which we refer to as ""fiscal .""

You should read the discussion that follows in conjunction with theconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere inthis Annual Report. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FISCAL COMPARED TO FISCAL On December , , we acquired approximately . of the outstandingvoting stock of Hills Stores Company. Accordingly, the operations of Hills andits subsidiaries during the month of January are included in our<PAGE>consolidated results of operations for fiscal . Immediately following ouracquisition of Hills, we began implementing a series of initiatives to preparefor the conversion of of the Hills stores into Ames stores and the permanentclosure of the five remaining Hills stores. These initiatives included thetermination of most of Hills\' corporate and administrative operations andpersonnel, the announced closure of seven Ames stores that we considered to bedirectly competitive with acquired Hills stores and the engagement of twoexperienced liquidation firms, Gordon Brothers Retail Partners and The NassiGroup, to operate the Hills stores until their closure and to liquidate Hills\'merchandise inventories. Under our agreement with Gordon Brothers and The Nassi Group, we areentitled to retain from the proceeds of the liquidation sales, as a minimumguaranteed amount, of the initial ticketed retail price of the inventorybeing sold, irrespective of the actual price at which it is sold. The remainingsale proceeds, net of the expenses of operating the stores, are payable to theliquidators as compensation for their services, subject to additionalallocations to Ames to the extent the proceeds exceed specified targets. Forfinancial reporting purposes, Hills\' net sales during the month of Januaryrepresent the actual sale proceeds from merchandise liquidation sales, its costof merchandise sold represents the guaranteed minimum amount that Ames isentitled to retain, and its selling, general and administrative expenses includethe portion of those proceeds that are to be paid over to the liquidators. Because of the unique nature of our contractual arrangements with GordonBrothers and The Nassi Group, as well as the fact that Hills stores were inthe process of liquidation, Hills\' results for the month of January are notrepresentative of those of a retailer operating in the ordinary course ofbusiness and are not directly comparable to Ames\' results exclusive of Hills.The acquisition of Hills also resulted in various costs and charges during themonth of January that impacted Ames\' consolidated results. These othercosts and charges consisted principally of costs associated with terminatingcontracts that became obsolete with the acquisition of Hills, the write-off ofdeferred financing costs related to a prior credit facility, interest expensefor borrowings incurred to finance the acquisition and a one-time charge for theannounced closing of the seven Ames stores. The following table illustrates theseparate contribution of Ames\' full year of operations and Hills\' one month ofoperations to various components of the consolidated results of operations forfiscal , as well as the impact on these consolidated results of the othercosts and charges described above: <TABLE><CAPTION> OTHER COSTS AMES HILLS AND CHARGES CONSOLIDATED -------- ------ ----------- ------------ (IN MILLIONS)<S> <C> <C> <C> <C>Net sales.............................................. ,. . -- ,.

Accordingly, in the discussion thatfollows, Ames\' net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrativeexpense, and its leased department and other income for fiscal arepresented and compared exclusive of the Hills results. The impact of the Hillsacquisition is included in the comparison of depreciation and amortizationexpense and interest and debt expense. Ames\' net sales (which exclude sales from leased shoe departments)increased ., to . billion in fiscal from . billion in fiscal, due primarily to . growth in same-store sales. Ames experiencedparticularly strong improvements in sales of domestics, toys, ready-to-assemblefurniture and women\'s sportswear. In comparing results for the two fiscal years,you should bear in mind that net sales in fiscal were favorably affected bythe inclusion of a full or nearly full year of operations of two stores thatwere closed in the beginning of fiscal and by the fact that fiscal included one additional week of operations. <PAGE> Ames\' gross margin increased . million in fiscal compared tofiscal , but remained unchanged as a percentage of net sales at .. Thegross margin rate in fiscal benefitted from a higher average markup onsales, which was partially offset by higher markdowns. Ames\' selling, general and administrative expenses increased . millionin fiscal , but decreased as a percentage of net sales from . in fiscal to . in fiscal . The percentage decrease was primarily attributableto a reduction in store related expenses and advertising expense, partiallyoffset by an increase in health and medical costs. Ames\' leased department and other income increased . million, or .,in fiscal compared to fiscal . The increase was due primarily to theleased shoe department, layaway and vending income, as well as the receipt offunds previously held in a trust. Ames\' depreciation and amortization expense increased by . million, or., in fiscal compared to fiscal . The increase related primarily tonew point-of-sale systems and store automation equipment acquired under certaincapital leases. The Hills acquisition added a further . million ofdepreciation and amortization expense associated with the additionaldepreciation and amortization of its fixed assets and beneficial lease rightsand the amortization of goodwill relating to the excess of the Hills acquisitioncost over the value of the acquired assets. We are amortizing the beneficiallease rights using the straight-line method over the terms of the related leases(which average approximately years) and are amortizing the Hills goodwillover years on a straight-line basis. The amortization of the excess of ourrevalued net assets over equity under fresh-start reporting remained the same infiscal as in fiscal . We are amortizing this amount over a ten-yearperiod that will conclude in January . The Hills acquisition resulted in a ., or . million, increase inconsolidated interest expense, net of interest income, in fiscal . Debt andcapital lease obligations of Hills accounted for . million of the increase.Another . million of the increase was attributable to the non-cash write-offof deferred financing costs under Ames\' prior credit facility. The balance wasattributable to borrowings under our bank credit agreement to finance the costsof the acquisition. In the fourth quarter of fiscal , we recorded charges of . millionin connection with the announced closing of seven Ames stores that are scheduledto close in fiscal . Principal components of these charges are for leasecosts and the write-down of fixed assets. We have also planned for the closingof five of the acquired Hills stores and, pursuant to the purchase method ofaccounting, have provided for these closings in the valuation of the acquiredHills assets. In the fourth quarter of fiscal , we recorded charges of. million in connection with the closing of two stores, of which. million was classified as a store closing charge and . million wasrecorded as part of the cost of merchandise sold. We recorded an income tax provision of . million in fiscal , ofwhich approximately . million will be paid in cash. In fiscal , werecorded an income tax provision of . million, of which approximately. million was paid in cash. See Note of the Notes to ConsolidatedFinancial Statements for an explanation of fresh-start reporting and SFASNo. . FISCAL COMPARED TO FISCAL We reported improvements in sales and net earnings for fiscal overfiscal . The improvements were due to the favorable impact of our opening new stores in the preceding two fiscal years, our closing of underperformingstores at the beginning of fiscal and the continued improvement in ourgross margin rate. <PAGE>The following table sets forth various components of Ames\' results of operationsfor fiscal and expressed in dollars and as a percentage of net sales: <TABLE><CAPTION> FISCAL FISCAL ----------------------------- ----------------------------- IN MILLIONS OF NET SALES IN MILLIONS OF NET SALES ----------- -------------- ----------- --------------<S> <C> <C> <C> <C>Net sales........................................ ,. . ,. .Costs and expenses (income): Cost of merchandise sold....................... ,. . ,. .

You should read the discussion that follows in conjunction with theconsolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in thisannual report on Form -K.Results of OperationsFiscal Compared to Fiscal During Fiscal , the inventory in the former Hills stores wasliquidated, and stores were remodeled and opened as Ames stores. This processwas completed in September . During the liquidation period, professionalliquidators operated the former Hills stores under an agency agreement withAmes. Under the agreement, Ames received a minimum guaranteed amount of ofthe initial ticketed retail price of the inventory sold and had the potential toreceive a greater return if the sale proceeds exceeded a specified percentage ofretail value. For financial reporting purposes in the charts that follow, Hillsnet sales represent the actual sale proceeds from the merchandise liquidationsales, its cost of merchandise sold represents the cost of merchandise sold asadjusted for the guaranteed return amount, and its selling general andadministrative expenses include the portion of those proceeds that were to bepaid to the liquidators. Upon completion of the liquidation and remodeling the Hills stores werereopened and participated in grand opening promotions. Consequently we incurredhigher than normal pre-opening and promotion expenses in Fiscal . Because of the liquidation activity, the remodeling activity and the largevolume of grand openings with their associated expenses, the consolidatedoperating results are not representative of those of a retailer operating in theordinary course of business and are not directly comparable to previouslypublished Ames results exclusive of Hills.<TABLE> Fiscal Fiscal ---- -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Layaway Ames Ames Hills Other Adj.

Including the effect of the Hills stores and other costsrelated to the acquisition, we recorded consolidated net income of . millionfor the fifty-two weeks ended January , . The ""Ames"" column for Fiscal (above) represents (a) the results ofthe Ames store base, (b) the results of the former Hills stores after theirconversion to Ames stores and (c) certain expenses associated with theacquisition of Hills, including the interest expense on the acquired Hillssenior notes and a prorata share of the amortization of the goodwill recorded inconnection with the acquisition. The ""Hills"" column for Fiscal (above) represents (a) the results ofoperations for the Hills stores during the period that these stores wereoperated pursuant to an agency agreement, including depreciation and interestexpense directly associated with such stores and (b) Hills corporate overheadexpenses, principally the Canton, Massachusetts\'s corporate facility (see Note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion ofthe agency agreement accounting). The ""Other"" column for Fiscal (above) represents expenses incurredduring the period of remodeling the Hills stores (i.e., pre-opening expensesincurred during the conversion or ""dark"" period) as well as certain otherexpenses and tax benefits. The above ""Layaway Adj."" column represents the impact of the change in themethod of accounting for layaway sales. We adopted the change in accounting forlayaway sales in the fourth quarter of Fiscal in consideration of the StaffAccounting Bulletin No. ""Revenue Recognition"" issued by the staff of theSecurities and Exchange Commission in December . The liquidation and remodeling activity in the former Hills storesdistorts any direct comparison of the principal components of Ames consolidatedresults for Fiscal and Fiscal and prior years. Accordingly, in thediscussion that follows, Ames net sales, gross margin, selling, general andadministrative expenses, and its leased department and other income for Fiscal and Fiscal will be compared excluding the pre-conversion Hills resultsand other charges. The comparison of depreciation and amortization expense aswell as interest and debt expense will be on a consolidated basis. Net sales increased to . billion in Fiscal from . billion inFiscal due primarily to the sales contribution of the former Hills storesafter conversion to the Ames format and . growth in same store sales. Weexperienced strong increases in our Ladies Sportswear, Toys and HomeEntertainment departments. Gross margin increased . million in Fiscal compared to Fiscal. The increase is primarily attributable to the inclusion of the formerHills stores and an increase in the gross margin rate from . to . inFiscal . The gross margin rate in Fiscal benefited from lowermarkdowns. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased . million inFiscal compared to Fiscal , primarily as a result of the addition ofthe former Hills stores. Selling general and administrative expenses decreasedas a percentage of net sales from . in Fiscal to . in Fiscal .The decrease resulted from the . comparable store sales gain and improvedefficiencies of scale due to the Hills acquisition. Leased department and other income increased . million in Fiscal from Fiscal . A substantial portion of the increase resulted from additionalleased sales originating in the former Hills stores, as well as an increase inlayaway fees, also originating in the former Hills stores. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by . million in Fiscal compared to Fiscal . The increase results from the additionaldepreciation and amortization of the former Hills fixed assets and beneficiallease rights and the amortization of goodwill. The beneficial lease rights andgoodwill related to the Hills acquisition are being amortized on a straight-linebasis over the term of the underlying lease ( years on average) for the leaserights and years for goodwill. The amortization of the excess of our revaluednet assets over equity under fresh start reporting remained the same in Fiscal as in Fiscal . We are amortizing this amount over a ten-year period,which will conclude in January . Net interest expense increased . million in Fiscal compared toFiscal . The increase was primarily attributable to interest expenseincurred for our senior notes, the Hills capital lease and financingobligations and a higher level of borrowings under our bank credit agreement.During the year, we completed the issuance of our senior notes to supportthe conversion of the former Hills stores. See the liquidity and capitalresources section of this document for further discussion of these events. We recorded a consolidated income tax benefit of . million in Fiscal compared to an . million provision in Fiscal . The Fiscal benefit primarily represents the reduction of a valuation allowance of .million previously recorded against certain deferred tax assets, which reflectsour expectation of using the net operating loss carry-forwards and otherdeferred tax assets in the foreseeable future. See Note to the consolidatedfinancial statements for additional information. Subsequent to the date of these financial statements, we announced thepurchase of the leases to seven Goldblatt\'s stores in the Chicago area, markingour entry to this market.Fiscal Compared to Fiscal On December , , we acquired approximately . of the outstandingvoting stock of Hills Stores Company. Accordingly, the operations of Hills andits subsidiaries during the month of January are included in ourconsolidated results of operations for Fiscal . Immediately following ouracquisition of Hills, we began implementing a series of initiatives to preparefor the conversion of of the Hills stores into Ames stores and the permanentclosure of the four remaining Hills stores. These initiatives included thetermination of most of Hills\' corporate and administrative operations andpersonnel, the announced closure of seven Ames stores that we considered to bedirectly competitive with acquired Hills stores or under-performing and theengagement of two experienced liquidation firms, Gordon Brothers Retail PartnersLLC and The Nassi Group LLC, to operate the Hills stores until their closure andto liquidate Hills\' merchandise inventories. Under our agreement with Gordon Brothers LLC and The Nassi Group LLC, wewere entitled to retain from the proceeds of the liquidation sales, as a minimumguaranteed amount, of the initial ticketed retail price of the inventorysold, irrespective of the actual price at which it is sold. The remaining saleproceeds, net of the expenses of operating the stores, were payable to theliquidators as compensation for their services, subject to additionalallocations to Ames to the extent that proceeds exceeded specified targets. Forfinancial reporting purposes, Hills\' net sales during the month of Januaryrepresent the actual sale proceeds from merchandise liquidation sales, its costof merchandise sold represents the guaranteed minimum amount that Ames isentitled to retain, and its selling, general and administrative expenses includethe portion of those proceeds that were paid to the liquidators. Because of the unique nature of our contractual arrangements with GordonBrothers LLC and The Nassi Group LLC, as well as the fact that the Hills storeswere in the process of liquidation, Hills\' results for the month of January are not representative of those of a retailer operating in the ordinary courseof business and are not directly comparable to Ames\' results exclusive of Hills.The acquisition of Hills also resulted in various costs and charges during themonth of January that impacted Ames\' consolidated results. These othercosts and charges consisted principally of costs associated with terminatingcontracts that became obsolete with the acquisition of Hills, the write-off ofdeferred financing costs related to a prior credit facility, interest expensefor borrowings incurred to finance the acquisition and a one-time charge for theannounced closing of the seven Ames stores. The following table illustrates theseparate contribution of Ames\' full year of operations and Hills\' one month ofoperations to various components of the consolidated results of operations forFiscal , as well as the impact on the consolidated results of the othercosts and charges described above:<PAGE><TABLE> Fiscal Fiscal ---------------------------------------------- ------ Ames Hills Other Total ---- ----- ----- ----- (In millions)<S> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C>Total net sales ,. ,. . - ,.Leased department and other income . . . - . ----------- ---------- --------- -------- ---------Total revenue ,. ,. . - ,.Costs and expenses:Cost of merchandise sold ,. ,. . - ,.Selling, general, and administrative expense . . . . .Depreciation and amortization expense, net . . . - .Interest and debt expense, net . . . . .Store closing charge . - - . . ----------- ---------- --------- -------- ---------Income (loss) before income taxes . .

Accordingly, in the discussion that follows,Ames\' net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative expenses, andits leased department and other income for Fiscal are presented andcompared exclusive of the Hills results. The impact of the Hills acquisition isincluded in the comparison of depreciation and amortization expense and interestand debt expense. Ames\' net sales increased ., to . billion in Fiscal from .billion in Fiscal , due primarily to . growth in same-store sales. Amesexperienced particularly strong sales improvements in sales of domestics, toys,ready to assemble furniture, and women\'s sportswear. In comparing results forthe two fiscal years, you should bear in mind that net sales in Fiscal werefavorably affected by the inclusion of a full or nearly full year of operationsof two stores that were closed in the beginning of Fiscal and by the factthat Fiscal included one additional week of operations. Ames\' gross margin increased . million in Fiscal compared toFiscal , but remained unchanged as a percentage of net sales at .. Thegross margin rate in Fiscal benefited from a higher average markup onsales, which was partially offset by higher markdowns. Ames\' selling, general and administrative expenses increased . millionin Fiscal , but decreased as a percentage of net sales from . in Fiscal to . in Fiscal . The percentage decrease was primarily attributableto a reduction in store related expenses and advertising expense, partiallyoffset by an increase in health and medical costs. Ames\' leased department and other income increased . million, or .,in Fiscal compared to Fiscal . The increase was due primarily to theleased shoe department, layaway and vending income, as well as the receipt offunds previously held in trust. Ames\' depreciation and amortization expense increased by . million, or., in Fiscal compared to Fiscal . The increase related primarily tonew point-of-sale systems and store automation equipment acquired under certaincapital leases. The Hills acquisition added a further . million ofdepreciation and amortization expense associated with the additionaldepreciation and amortization of its fixed assets and beneficial lease rightsand the amortization of goodwill relating to the excess of the Hills acquisitioncost over the value of the acquired assets. We are amortizing the beneficiallease rights using the straight-line method over the terms of the related leases(which average approximately years) and are amortizing the Hills goodwillover years on a straight-line basis. The amortization of the excess of ourrevalued net assets over equity under fresh-start reporting remained the same inFiscal as in Fiscal . We are amortizing this amount over a ten-yearperiod that will conclude in January . The Hills acquisition resulted in a ., or . million, increase inconsolidated interest expense, net of interest income, in Fiscal . Debt andcapital lease obligations of Hills accounted for . million of the increase.Another . million of the increase was attributable to the non-cash write-offof deferred financing costs under Ames\' prior credit facility. The balance wasattributable to borrowings under our bank credit agreement to finance costs ofthe acquisition. In the fourth quarter of Fiscal , we recorded charges of . millionin connection with the announced closing of seven Ames stores that werescheduled to close in Fiscal . Principal components of these charges werelease costs and the write-down of fixed assets. We also planned for the closingof four of the acquired Hills stores and, pursuant to the purchase method ofaccounting, provided for these closings in the valuation of the acquired Hillsassets. In the fourth quarter of Fiscal , we recorded charges of .million in connection with the closing of two stores, of which . million wasclassified as a store closing charge and . million was recorded as part ofthe cost of merchandise sold. We recorded an income tax provision of . million in Fiscal , ofwhich approximately . million was paid in cash. In Fiscal , we recordedan income tax provision of . million, of which approximately . millionwas paid in cash. See Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Liquidity and Capital Resources Ames\' principal sources of liquidity are its bank credit agreement, cashfrom operations and cash on hand. Our current bank credit agreement provides fora revolving credit facility of up to million expiring June , .Borrowings under the agreement are secured by substantially all of our assetsand we are required to meet certain financial covenants if our availabilityunder the credit agreement falls below specified levels. Our peak borrowinglevel in Fiscal under the agreement was . million. On April , , we completed the sale of million of Ames senior notes. The net proceeds from the sale of the Ames senior notes,approximately . million, were used to reduce outstanding borrowings underour bank credit facility. The Ames senior notes pay interest semi-annually inApril and October and mature in April . On May , , we completed the public offering of . million shares ofCommon Stock at a price of . per share. The proceeds of approximately. million, net of underwriting discounts, were used to reduce ourborrowings under the bank credit facility and for general corporate purposes. Our cash position decreased . million during Fiscal . The decreasewas due primarily to . million of capital expenditures, inventoryinvestments of . million and . million in debt and capital leasepayments, partially offset by . million of borrowings under our bank creditagreement, . million from the issuance of the Ames senior notes and the netamount of . million from the issuance of Common Stock. Our cash positiondecreased by . million during Fiscal . This decrease was due primarilyto . million paid out in the acquisition of Hills (net of cash acquired),. million of capital expenditures and . million in debt and capitallease payments partially offset by . million in cash from operations and. million of borrowings under our bank credit facility. Merchandise inventories increased . million in Fiscal due tothe addition of twelve new stores, in addition to fully stocking the formerHills stores and recording the inventory in the converted Hills stores at costin Fiscal as compared to liquidation value in Fiscal . In Fiscal ,the Hills inventories were valued at approximately of the ticketed retailprice of the merchandise, representing the minimum amount we were entitled toretain out of the proceeds from the liquidation of the merchandise. Merchandiseinventories increased by . million in Fiscal due to planned increasesand the inclusion of . million of Hills merchandise inventories. Net fixed assets increased by . million during Fiscal due to. million in capital expenditures, primarily relating to remodeling theformer Hills stores (. million), and opening twelve other stores. Theseadditions were partially offset by the additional writedown of . million infixed assets acquired from Hills and depreciation expense of . millionrecorded during Fiscal . Net fixed assets increased by . million duringFiscal due to the inclusion of . million in net fixed assets of Hillsand . million of capital expenditures, including . million in new pointof sale equipment under capital leases. The Hills net fixed assets were adjustedto their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date. Beneficial lease rights represent the excess of the fair market value ofthe acquired Hills leases over contract value of those leases. We are amortizingthis amount over the terms of the related leases using the straight-line method. Goodwill decreased . million as a result of the final determination ofthe fair market value of the assets and liabilities acquired with the Hillsstores and a full year of amortization expense, which approximated . million.The primary changes were the reduction of . million deferred tax assetvaluation allowance (see Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements), areduction in accrued liabilities and reserves of . million as theseliabilities were no longer deemed to be required and the increase of .million to inventory values. When the Hills inventory was liquidated, proceedsgenerated were greater than anticipated. These changes were partially offset byan additional . million write-down of fixed assets (primarily fixtures)acquired from Hills to recognize their deemed fair value. Goodwill is beingamortized over years using the straight-line method. Accounts payable increased . million due to an increase in merchandisereceipts in January over January . Accounts payable increased .million during Fiscal due to improved payment terms, and the inclusion ofHills accounts payable of . million as of January , . Long-term debt as of January , consisted of borrowings under ourbank credit agreement of . million, . million of Hills senior notes and million of Ames senior notes. Subsequent to fiscal year end we announcedthat we had amended our million credit facility. The amended agreementprovides Ames with a reduction in the interest rate charged and enhancedflexibility as to the usage of the funds available under the credit facility. Capital lease and financing obligations decreased by . million duringFiscal as payments on capital lease obligations exceeded new capitalleases. We have not paid any cash dividends during the past four fiscal years. Thepayment of cash dividends is restricted under the terms of our bank creditagreement.Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures for Fiscal were . million and included,among other items, the opening of twelve new stores, the remodeling of theformer Hills stores and the upgrading of selected management informationsystems, including the completion of our chain-wide installation of newpoint-of-sale information equipment and related software in our stores. Capitalexpenditures for Fiscal were . million and included the opening of sixnew stores, the remodeling of twenty-two stores, and the upgrading of certainmanagement information systems. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately . million forFiscal . These capital expenditures will be comprised of remodeling andconversion of the former Goldblatt\'s stores, new stores, and maintenance ofour existing stores. We expect to finance these expenditures through cash flowfrom operations and borrowings under our bank credit agreement. Land, buildingsand improvements are financed principally through long-term leases.Seasonality Our business is seasonal in nature, with a large portion of our net salesoccurring in the second half of our fiscal year as a result of theback-to-school and Christmas shopping seasons. Net sales are highest in the lastfiscal quarter ( of our annual net sales in Fiscal ). The demand forworking capital is heaviest in May, and from August through November, whensufficient merchandise must be purchased for the spring, back-to-school andChristmas seasons, respectively.Legal We are party to various claims and legal proceedings on a wide range ofmatters that arise in the ordinary course of business. Ames intends to defendthese issues vigorously and believes that the final outcome of the variousproceedings will not have a material adverse impact on its consolidatedfinancial position or results of operations (see Item Legal Proceedings).Impact of Year Ames completed its remediation and testing of systems for Year vulnerabilities in late . No disruptions in mission critical informationtechnology and non-information technology systems were experienced during the changeover and we believe those systems successfully responded to theYear date change. Ames expensed approximately . million during inconnection with its Year remediation efforts. Our total cost for our Year effort was approximately . million. We are not aware of any materialproblems resulting from Year issues, either with our products and internalsystems, or with the products and services of third parties. We will continue tomonitor mission critical computer applications and those of our suppliers andvendors throughout the Year to ensure that any latent Year mattersthat may arise are addressed promptly.Accounting Policy Matters In June the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement ofFinancial Accounting Standards (""SFAS"") No. , "" Accounting for DerivativeInstruments and Hedging Activities."" This statement establishes accounting andreporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument (includingcertain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded in thebalance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair market value.The statement also requires that changes in derivatives fair market value berecognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria aremet. SFAS No. is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal yearsbeginning after June , , with early adoption at the beginning of anyfiscal quarter being permitted. We are currently analyzing the impact of thisnew pronouncement on our financial position and result of operations. In December the Securities and Exchange Commission issued StaffAccounting Bulletin (""SAB"") No. ""Revenue Recognition."" Under SAB No. , weare required to change the method in which we account for layaway sales. Priorto the adoption of SAB No. , we recorded layaway sales when customers placedmerchandise on layaway. The pronouncement mandates that layaway sales berecorded when the customer takes possession of the merchandise. We adopted SABNo. during the fourth quarter of Fiscal , effective as of the beginningof Fiscal . The impact of adopting this pronouncement resulted in acumulative effect adjustment to current earnings for approximately . million,net of . million tax benefit. We adopted Statement of Position (""SOP"") - ""Accounting for the Costs ofComputer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use"" effective thebeginning of Fiscal . SOP - was effective for fiscal years beginningafter December , . This SOP requires companies to capitalize certain costsincurred in connection with an internal-use software project. Prior to Fiscal, we expensed the costs of developing or obtaining internal use software asincurred. The amount of internal use software costs capitalized in Fiscal was approximately . million.Forward-Looking Statements The statements contained or incorporated by reference in thisManagement\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations and elsewhere in this Annual Report that are not historical facts are""forward-looking statements,"" as that term is defined in the Private SecuritiesLitigation Reform Act of .

MANAGEMENT\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction withthe consolidated condensed financial statements and Notes presented in thisreport.Results of Operations The consolidated results of operations for the quarter ended May , include the results of the former Hills stores during the period they wereoperated by Gordon Brothers and The Nassi Group under an agency agreement. Thesefirms were engaged to operate the Hills stores until their closure and toliquidate the merchandise inventories. During the quarter ended May , , Gordon Brothers and The Nassi Groupcompleted the merchandise liquidation sales in of the former Hills stores.Subsequent to the liquidation sales, the Company remodeled of these storesduring an eight-week period and, on April , , the Company re-opened theremodeled stores as Ames stores. In addition, Gordon Brothers and The NassiGroup initiated the liquidation sales in former Hills stores in late Marchand the final liquidation sales in former Hills stores in early May. The following table illustrates the results of Ames\' operations for thequarter ended April , , as compared to the separate contributions of Ames\'and Hills\' operations and the other costs described below to the consolidatedresults of operations for the quarter ended May , .<TABLE> ------------------------------------------------ For The Thirteen Weeks Ended May , ------------------------------------------------ For the ------------------------------------------------ Thirteen (In Thousands) Weeks Ended April , Ames Hills Other Total -------------- ---- ----- ----- -----<S> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C>Net sales , , , - ,Leased department and other income , , , - , ------------------------------------------------------------------Total revenue , , , - ,Cost and expenses:Cost of merchandise sold , , , - ,Selling, general and administrative expenses , , , , ,Depreciation and amortization expenses, net , , , , ,Interest and debt expense, net , , , , , ------------------------------------------------------------------Loss before income taxes and cumulative effect (,) (,) (,) (,) (,)Income tax benefit , , , , , ------------------------------------------------------------------Loss before cumulative effect of accountingchange (,) (,) (,) (,) (,)Cumulative effect of accounting change, net oftax - - - (,) (,) ------------------------------------------------------------------Net loss (,) (,) (,) (,) (,) ==================================================================<TABLE> The Ames column represents (a) the results of the Ames store base, (b) theresults of the converted Hills stores after their re-opening as Ames stores and(c) certain expenses associated with the acquisition of Hills, includinginterest expense on the acquired Hills senior notes and a pro rata share of theamortization of goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition. The Hills column represents (a) the results of operations for the Hillsstores during the period that these stores were operated pursuant to the GordonBrothersNassi Agency Agreement, including depreciation and interest expensedirectly associated with such stores and (b) Hills corporate overhead expenses,principally the Canton, MA facility. The Other column represents the expenses incurred during the period ofremodeling the Hills stores (for example, pre-opening expenses incurred duringthe conversion or ""dark"" period) as well as certain other expenses. The unique circumstances under which Hills\' operations were conductedthrough the quarter ended May , distort any direct comparison of theprincipal components of Ames\' consolidated results for the quarters ended April, and May , . In the discussion that follows, Ames\' net sales, grossmargin, and selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter endedApril , are compared to the Ames\' results for the quarter ended May ,, exclusive of the Hills results and other expenses. The comparison ofdepreciation and amortization expense and interest and debt expense will be on aconsolidated basis. Ames\' net sales increased . million or in the first quarter of compared to the prior year\'s first quarter. This increase is primarily aresult of the inclusion of all of the converted Hills stores in the Amesstore base for the entire quarter compared to only stores for two weeksduring the quarter ended May , . Comparable store sales increased .during the first quarter. Gross margin increased . million or in the first quarter of from the first quarter of . The increase is a result of the increased numberof Ames stores, as previously discussed. Gross margin as a percentage of salesdeclined slightly from . to .. The decrease was mainly the result ofslightly higher markdowns and changes in merchandise mix. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased . million or as a result of the expanded Ames store base. Expenses as a percentage of salesincreased from . to . primarily as a result of sales falling short ofplanned levels. Depreciation and amortization expense increased . million or . Theincrease resulted primarily from a full quarter of additional depreciation onthe remodeling expenditures associated with conversion of the former Hillsstores. Interest expense increased . million or . The increase is mainlyattributed to a higher level of borrowings under our revolving credit facilityas well as a full quarter\'s interest expense for the Ames Senior Notes issued inApril of . Our estimated annual effective income tax rate for each year was applied tothe loss before income taxes for each period to compute a non-cash income taxbenefit. The income tax benefits are included in current assets in the balancesheet as of April , and May , .Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our revolving credit facility, cashfrom operations and cash on hand. Our revolving credit facility, which expiresJune , , provides credit of up to million. Borrowings under therevolving credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets. Inaddition, we are required to meet certain financial covenants if ouravailability under the credit facility falls below a specified level. During thefirst quarter we increased our drawings on the credit facility approximately. million but our availability did not fall below the specified level. Ourpeak borrowing level under the facility during the quarter ended April , was . million. We believe we will have sufficient liquidity to meet ourfinancial obligations for the foreseeable future. Merchandise inventories increased . million from January , dueprimarily to an unexpected sales shortfall during the first quarter and aseasonal merchandise build up. Merchandise inventories increased . millionfrom May , primarily as a result of fully stocking the converted Hillsstores and changing inventory valuation in approximately two-thirds of thosestores from liquidation value to cost. Trade accounts payable decreased approximately million from January , primarily as a result of a slowdown in merchandise purchases in response tothe first quarter sales shortfall. Trade accounts payable increased .million from May , due to the increase in merchandise inventoriesreferenced above. Capital expenditures for the thirteen weeks ended April , totaled. million and for the balance of the year are estimated to be approximately. million. We adjust our plans for making such expenditures depending on theamount of internally generated funds. Net fixed assets increased . million from January , primarilydue to . million in capital expenditures offset by . million indepreciation expense. In April , the Company consummated its purchase of the leases for sevenstores from Goldblatt\'s Department Stores, Inc. for a cash purchase price of. million. Six of the stores are located in Chicago, Illinois and one is inGary, Indiana. Beneficial lease rights represent the excess of the fair market value ofthe acquired Hills leases over contract value of those leases. We are amortizingthis amount over the terms of the related leases (which average approximately years) using the straight-line method. Goodwill is being amortized over yearsusing the straight-line method. Long-term debt as of April , consisted of borrowings under our bankcredit facility of . million, . million of the Ames senior notesissued in April and . million of the Hills senior notes that remainedoutstanding after the acquisition. The Hills senior notes became directobligations of Ames as a result of the merger of Hills into Ames. Capital lease and financing obligations decreased . million from January, to April , due primarily to payments made on capital leaseobligations. Capital lease and financing obligations decreased . million fromMay , to April , primarily as result of payments slightly exceedingnew capital lease commitments. The net operating loss carryovers remaining after fiscal , subject toany limitations pursuant to Internal Revenue code Sec , should offset incomeon which taxes would otherwise be payable in the next several years.Note Concerning Forward-looking Statements Statements, other than those based on historical facts which addressactivities, events, or developments that the Company expects or anticipates mayoccur in the future are forward-looking statements which are based upon a numberof assumptions concerning further conditions that may ultimately prove to beinaccurate.

Subscriber incentive expense increased in order tomaintain and expand Sabre\'s travel agency subscriber base and torespond to competitor pressures. The increase in depreciation andamortization expense was due primarily to the amortization of thedeferred asset associated with the stock options granted to USAirways, the acquisition of information technology assets to supportthe US Airways\' contract, and normal additions. These increases werepartially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense due to the saleof data center mainframe equipment to an unrelated party in October. Advertising and miscellaneous selling expenses increased inorder to support the Company\'s growth initiatives. Data processingcosts increased due to the growth in bookings and transactions processed. In an effort to balance costs with revenue growth, and as a result ofcertain inefficiencies uncovered after Sabre\'s March reorganization,Sabre is reviewing a number of alternatives aimed at strategicallymanaging costs and improving operating margins in the latter halfof . Such alternatives may result in headcount reductions incertain areas, reduced spending on discretionary items, andprioritization and streamlining of current development projects inorder to focus resources on those that provide the best long-termsolution. Sabre intends to implement such measures withoutcompromising the service levels or commitments to its existingcustomers or reducing sales and marketing efforts to continue to growthe outsourcing business.Other IncomeOther income increased million primarily due to a milliongain on the sale of Equant N.V. depository certificates held byAmerican for the economic benefit of Sabre. --<PAGE> LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESNet cash provided by operating activities in the six-month periodended June , was . billion, a decrease of million overthe same period in . This decrease resulted primarily from adecrease in net earnings, partially offset by an increase in the airtraffic liability due to higher advanced sales. Capital expendituresfor the first six months of were . billion, and included theacquisition of Boeing -s, Boeing -IGWs, six Boeing-s, four Boeing -ERs and Embraer aircraft. Thesecapital expenditures were financed with internally generated cash,except for Boeing aircraft which were financed through securedmortgage agreements, one Boeing aircraft which was financed through asale-leaseback transaction, and the Embraer aircraft which werefunded through secured debt agreements. As of June , , the Company had commitments to acquire thefollowing aircraft: Boeing -s, Boeing -IGWs, Embraer EMB-s, Bombardier CRJ-s and Embraer EMB-s. InJuly , the Company exercised its purchase rights to acquire threeadditional Boeing -IGWs. Deliveries of these aircraft willextend through . Payments for these aircraft will approximate. billion during the remainder of , . billion in , .billion in and an aggregate of approximately . billion in through . The Company expects to fund its remaining capitalexpenditures from the Company\'s existing cash and short-terminvestments, internally generated cash, and new financing dependingupon capital market conditions and the Company\'s evolving view of itslong-term needs. In April , the Company announced that it will accelerate theretirement of nine McDonnell Douglas DC- and Boeing -aircraft earlier than anticipated, thereby eliminating American\'sentire DC- fleet by the end of and advancing the retirement ofthe Boeing fleet to the end of . On July , , the Company issued million of unsecured debtbearing interest at . percent, maturing on July , , and iscallable at par after July , . During the six months ended June , , the Company purchasedapproximately . million shares of its common stock at a cost ofapproximately million. Additional share repurchases of up to million, which is the remaining amount currently authorized bythe Company\'s Board of Directors, may be made from time to time,depending on market conditions, and may be discontinued at any time. In March , Sabre\'s Board of Directors authorized, subject tocertain business and market conditions, the repurchase of up to .million shares of Sabre\'s Class A Common Stock. During the six monthsended June , , Sabre purchased approximately , shares at acost of approximately million. In connection with a secondary offering by Equant N.V. in February, the Company sold approximately , depository certificatesfor proceeds of million. During the first six months of ,the Company acquired approximately , depository certificatesfrom other airlines. In addition, based upon a reallocation betweenthe owners of the certificates in July , the Company received anadditional . million certificates. Accordingly, as of July ,, the Company holds approximately . million depositorycertificates with an estimated market value of approximately million. --<PAGE> YEAR READINESSState of Readiness In , the Company implemented a project (theYear Project) to ensure that hardware and software systemsoperated by the Company, including software licensed to or operatedfor third parties by Sabre, are designed to operate and properlymanage dates beyond December , (Year Readiness). The Year Project consists of six phases: (i) awareness, (ii) assessment,(iii) analysis, design and remediation, (iv) testing and validation,(v) quality assurance review (to ensure consistency throughout theYear Project) and (vi) creation of business continuity strategy,including plans in the event of Year failures. In developing theCompany\'s proprietary software analysis, remediation and testingmethodology for Year Readiness, it studied the best practices ofthe Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the BritishStandards Institution. The Company has assessed (i) the Company\'sover , information technology and operating systems that will beutilized after December , (IT Systems); (ii) non-informationtechnology systems, including embedded technology, facilities, andother systems (Non-IT Systems); and (iii) the Year Readiness ofits critical third party service providers. IT Systems The Company has completed the first three phases ofthe Year Project for all of its IT Systems. The Company hassuccessfully completed the testing and validation phase and qualityassurance review phase for percent of its IT Systems, including itscomputer reservations and flight operating systems that perform such""mission critical"" functions as passenger bookings, ticketing,passenger check-in, aircraft weight and balance, flight planning andbaggage and cargo processing. As of July , , approximately percent of those IT Systems (including the computer reservationssystems) are already successfully processing Year dates inactual use. Using dedicated testing environments and applying rigorous teststandards, the Company is actively testing the remaining one percentof its IT Systems to determine if they are Year ready or iffurther remediation is necessary. The Company estimates completingthe testing and validation phase and quality assurance review phase,and the business continuity phase for its remaining IT Systems duringthe third quarter of . Non-IT Systems The Company has completed the first five phasesof the Year project for percent of its Non-IT Systems, such asaircraft avionics and flight simulators. The Company estimatescompleting the final phase of business continuity for its Non-ITsystems during the third quarter of . Third Party Services The Company\'s business is dependent uponentities which supply critical infrastructure to the airlineindustry, such as the air traffic control and related systems of theFederal Aviation Administration and international aviationauthorities, the Department of Transportation, and airportauthorities. Those service providers depend on their hardware andsoftware systems and on interfaces with the Company\'s IT Systems.The Company is actively involved in the Air Transport Association(ATA) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Year Airline Industry Program to ensure the readiness of airports,air traffic service providers, and commercial airline suppliersworldwide. As part of this program, the ATA and IATA are monitoringapproximately , airports, air traffic control serviceproviders, and more than , commercial airline suppliersthroughout the world regarding their Year Readiness. Theresults of these studies indicate that a majority of the domestic andinternational airports in which American operates have madesignificant progress towards their Year Readiness.Nevertheless, the Company continues to closely monitor the progressof a number of key airports that, if not properly prepared for theYear , could disrupt the Company\'s ability to provide services toits customers. In addition, the Company relies on third party service providersfor many services, such as telecommunications, electrical power, anddata and credit card transaction processing. Those service providersdepend on their hardware and software systems and on interfaces withthe Company\'s IT Systems. The Company is monitoring its critical serviceproviders regarding their Year Readiness and has receivedresponses from approximately percent of its critical serviceproviders. Such respondents assured the Company that their softwareand hardware is or will be Year ready. To the extent practical,the Company will implement contingencies for the third party criticalservice providers that have not responded. The Company does not expect the Year issues it mightencounter with third parties to be materially different from thoseencountered by other airlines, including the Company\'s competitors. --<PAGE> Costs of Year Project The Company expects to incur significanthardware, software and labor costs, as well as consulting and otherexpenses, in its Year Project. The Company\'s total estimated costof the project is to million, of which approximately million was incurred as of June , . Costs associated withthe Year Project are expensed as incurred, other than capitalizedhardware costs, and have been funded through cash from operations.Risks of Year Non-readiness The economy in general, and thetravel and transportation industries in particular, may be adverselyaffected by risks associated with the Year . The Company\'sbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations could bematerially adversely affected if systems that it operates or systemsthat are operated by third party service providers upon which theCompany relies are not Year ready in time. There can be noassurance that these systems will continue to properly function andinterface and will otherwise be Year ready. Management believesthat its most likely Year risks relate to the failure of thirdparties with whom it has material relationships to be Year ready. Although the Company is not aware of any threatened claims relatedto the Year , the Company may be subject to litigation arisingfrom such claims and, depending on the outcome, such litigation couldhave a material adverse affect on the Company. There can be noassurance that the Company\'s insurance coverage would be adequate tooffset these and other business risks related to the Year issue.Business Continuity Plans The Company has identified four potentialrisk areas related to the Year and is developing and refiningplans to continue its business in the event of Year failures inresponse to those risks. The Company believes that its most likelyYear risks relate to the failure of third parties with whom ithas material relationships to be Year compliant. In response tothis risk, the Company has been actively participating with the ATAand IATA Year Airline Industry program to ensure the readiness ofairports and air traffic services worldwide. The Company is in theprocess of collecting additional business continuity information fromsuch suppliers in order to effectively manage any failures. The secondrisk area relates to the effective prioritization and management ofany Year failures. The Company is establishing an EnterpriseCommand Center in order to prioritize issues, manage resources,coordinate problem resolution and communicate status in the event ofYear failures. The third risk area relates to the possibilitythat the Company\'s employees will fail to report to work on or aroundDecember , , thereby potentially disrupting the Company\'s operations.In order to mitigate such risk, American may voluntarily reduce itsschedule during this timeframe. The fourth risk area relates to thefailure of critical internal business processes, services, systems andfacilities. Although the Company has tested all systems including thosenot impacted by dates, the Company is developing business continuityplans to manage potential internal Year failures and expects tocomplete these plans by September , . The Company\'s business continuityplans include performing certain processes manually; maintainingdedicated staff to be available at crucial dates to remedy unforeseenproblems; installing defensive code to protect real-time systems fromimproperly formatted date data supplied by third parties; repairing orobtaining replacement systems; and reducing or suspending certain non-critical aspects of the Company\'s services or operations. Because ofthe pervasiveness and complexity of the Year issue, and inparticular the uncertainty concerning the efforts and success of thirdparties to be Year compliant, the Company will continue to refineits contingency plans during . The costs of the project and the date on which the Company plansto complete the Year Readiness program are based on management\'sbest estimates, which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions offuture events including the continued availability of certainresources, third party modification plans and other factors.Even though the Company has met all established deadlines and the costestimates have remained constant, actual results could differ materiallyfrom these estimates. Specific factors that might cause such materialdifferences include, but are not limited to, the availability andcost of personnel trained in this area, the ability to locate andcorrect all relevant computer codes, the failure of third parties tobe Year ready, and similar uncertainties. --<PAGE> DALLAS LOVE FIELDIn , as part of an agreement between the cities of Fort Worth andDallas to build and operate DallasFort Worth Airport (DFW), a bondordinance was enacted by both cities (the Bond Ordinance). The BondOrdinance required both cities to direct all scheduled interstatepassenger operations to DFW and was an integral part of the bondsissued for the construction and operation of DFW. In , as part ofa settlement to resolve litigation with Southwest Airlines, the citiesagreed to expand the scope of operations allowed under the BondOrdinance at Dallas\' Love Field. Congress enacted the WrightAmendment to prevent the federal government from acting inconsistentwith this agreement. The Wright Amendment limited interstateoperations at Love Field to the four states contiguous to Texas (NewMexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana) and prohibited throughticketing to any destination outside that perimeter. In , withoutthe consent of either city, Congress amended the Wright Amendment by(i) adding three states (Kansas, Mississippi and Alabama) to theperimeter and (ii) removing some federal restrictions on largeaircraft configured with seats or less (the Amendment). InOctober , the City of Fort Worth filed suit in state districtcourt against the City of Dallas and others seeking to enforce theBond Ordinance. Fort Worth contends that the Amendment does notpreclude the City of Dallas from exercising its proprietary rights torestrict traffic at Love Field in a manner consistent with the BondOrdinance and, moreover, that Dallas has an obligation to do so.American joined in this litigation. On October , , the statedistrict court granted summary judgment in favor of Fort Worth andAmerican, which summary judgment is being appealed to the Fort WorthCourt of Appeals. In the same lawsuit, DFW filed claims alleging thatirrespective of whether the Bond Ordinance is enforceable, the DFW UseAgreement prohibits American and other DFW signatory airlines frommoving any interstate operations to Love Field. These claims remainunresolved. Dallas filed a separate declaratory judgment action infederal district court seeking to have the court declare that, as amatter of law, the Amendment precludes Dallas from exercising anyrestrictions on operations at Love Field. Further, in May ,Continental Airlines and Continental Express filed a lawsuit infederal court seeking a judicial declaration that the Bond Ordinancecannot be enforced to prevent them from operating flights from LoveField to Cleveland using regional jets. In December , theDepartment of Transportation (DOT) issued an order on the federal lawquestions concerning the Bond Ordinance, local proprietary powers,DFW\'s Use Agreement with DFW carriers such as American, and the Wrightand Amendments, and concluded that the Bond Ordinance waspreempted by federal law and was therefore, not enforceable. The DOTalso found that the DFW Use Agreement did not preclude American fromconducting interstate operations at Love Field. Fort Worth, Americanand DFW have appealed the DOT\'s order to the Fifth Circuit Court ofAppeals. As a result of the foregoing, the future of interstate flightoperations at Love Field and American\'s DFW hub are uncertain. Anincrease in operations at Love Field to new interstate destinationscould adversely impact American\'s business.FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATIONStatements in this report contain various forward-looking statementswithin the meaning of Section A of the Securities Act of , asamended, and Section E of the Securities Exchange Act of , asamended, which represent the Company\'s expectations or beliefsconcerning future events.

In the event ofa spin-off of Sabre, the earnings and assets of Sabre would no longerbe available to AMR.YEAR READINESSState of Readiness In , the Company implemented a project (theYear Project) to ensure that hardware and software systemsoperated by the Company, including software licensed to or operatedfor third parties by Sabre, are designed to operate and properlymanage dates beyond December , (Year Readiness). The Year Project consists of six phases: (i) awareness, (ii) assessment,(iii) analysis, design and remediation, (iv) testing and validation,(v) quality assurance review (to ensure consistency throughout theYear Project) and (vi) creation of business continuity strategy,including plans in the event of Year failures. In developing theCompany\'s proprietary software analysis, remediation and testingmethodology for Year Readiness, it studied the best practices ofthe Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the BritishStandards Institution. The Company has assessed (i) the Company\'sover , information technology and operating systems that will beutilized after December , (IT Systems); (ii) non-informationtechnology systems, including embedded technology, facilities, andother systems (Non-IT Systems); and (iii) the Year Readiness ofits critical third party service providers. IT Systems The Company has completed the first five phases ofthe Year Project for all of its IT Systems, including itscomputer reservations and flight operating system applications thatperform such ""mission critical"" functions as passenger bookings,ticketing, passenger check-in, aircraft weight and balance, flightplanning and baggage and cargo processing. As of October , ,approximately percent of those IT Systems (including the computerreservations systems) are already successfully processing Year dates in actual use. The Company has installed Year Readinesshardware and software at all of its locations worldwide. The Companyis following structured clean management processes to keep all of itsIT Systems Year ready. Non-IT Systems The Company has completed the first five phasesof the Year project for all of its Non-IT Systems which includesaircraft avionics and flight simulators. The Company believes that ishas adequate contingency plans to ensure business continuity if any ofits Non-IT systems are not Year ready. --<PAGE> Third Party Services The Company\'s business is dependent uponentities which supply critical infrastructure to the airlineindustry, such as the air traffic control and related systems of theFederal Aviation Administration and international aviationauthorities, the Department of Transportation, and airportauthorities. Those service providers depend on their hardware andsoftware systems and on interfaces with the Company\'s IT Systems.The Company is actively involved in the Air Transport Association(ATA) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Year Airline Industry Program to ensure the readiness of airports,air traffic service providers, and commercial airline suppliersworldwide. As part of this program, the ATA and IATA are monitoringapproximately , airports, air traffic control serviceproviders, and more than , commercial airline suppliersthroughout the world regarding their Year Readiness. Theresults of these studies indicate that a majority of the domestic andinternational airports in which American operates have madesignificant progress towards their Year Readiness.Nevertheless, the Company continues to closely monitor the progressof a number of key airports that, if not properly prepared for theYear , could disrupt the Company\'s ability to provide services toits customers. In addition, the Company relies on third party service providersfor many services, such as telecommunications, electrical power, anddata and credit card transaction processing. Those service providersdepend on their hardware and software systems and on interfaces withthe Company\'s IT Systems. The Company is monitoring its criticalservice providers regarding their Year Readiness and has receivedresponses from over percent of its critical service providers.Such respondents assured the Company that their software and hardwareis or will be Year ready. To the extent practical, the Companywill implement contingencies for the third party critical serviceproviders that have not responded. The Company does not expect the Year issues it mightencounter with third parties to be materially different from thoseencountered by other airlines, including the Company\'s competitors.Costs of Year Project The Company expects to incur significanthardware, software and labor costs, as well as consulting and otherexpenses, in its Year Project. The Company\'s total estimated costof the project is to million, of which approximately million was incurred as of September , . Costs associatedwith the Year Project are expensed as incurred, other thancapitalized hardware costs, and have been funded through cash fromoperations.Risks of Year Non-readiness The economy in general, and thetravel and transportation industries in particular, may be adverselyaffected by risks associated with the Year . The Company\'sbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations could bematerially adversely affected if systems that it operates or systemsthat are operated by third party service providers upon which theCompany relies are not Year ready in time. There can be noassurance that these systems will continue to properly function andinterface and will otherwise be Year ready. Management believesthat its most likely Year risks relate to the failure of thirdparties with whom it has material relationships to be Year ready. Although the Company is not aware of any threatened claims relatedto the Year , the Company may be subject to litigation arisingfrom such claims and, depending on the outcome, such litigation couldhave a material adverse affect on the Company. There can be noassurance that the Company\'s insurance coverage would be adequate tooffset these and other business risks related to the Year issue.Business Continuity Plans The Company has identified four potentialrisk areas related to the Year and is developing and refiningplans to continue its business in the event of Year failures inresponse to those risks. The Company believes that its most likelyYear risks relate to the failure of third parties with whom ithas material relationships to be Year ready. In response to thisrisk, the Company has been actively participating with the ATA andIATA Year Airline Industry Program to ensure the readiness ofairports and air traffic services worldwide. The Company is in theprocess of collecting additional business continuity information fromsuch suppliers in order to effectively manage any failures. Thesecond risk area relates to the effective prioritization andmanagement of any Year failures. The Company is establishing anEnterprise Command Center in order to prioritize issues, manageresources, coordinate problem resolution and communicate status in theevent of Year failures. The third risk area relates to thepossibility that the Company\'s employees will fail to report to workon or around December , , thereby potentially disrupting theCompany\'s operations. Somewhat mitigating this risk is that the Companywill be operating a reduced holiday schedule due to soft passenger demand.In addition, the Company may undertake initiatives to encourage personnelto work as scheduled. The fourth risk area relates to the failure ofcritical internal business processes, services, systems and facilities. --<PAGE> The Company has tested all systems including those not impacted bydates and has completed approximately percent of its businesscontinuity plans to manage potential internal Year failures. TheCompany\'s business continuity plans include performing certainprocesses manually; maintaining dedicated staff to be available atcrucial dates to remedy unforeseen problems; installing defensive codeto protect real-time systems from improperly formatted date datasupplied by third parties; repairing or obtaining replacement systems;and reducing or suspending certain non-critical aspects of theCompany\'s services or operations. In addition, the Company willassess its operational readiness by evaluating mission criticalsystems and reporting the status to the Enterprise Command Center.Appropriate actions will be taken when issues regarding industryreadiness impacts the airline\'s operations. Because of thepervasiveness and complexity of the Year issue, and in particularthe uncertainty concerning the efforts and success of third parties tobe Year ready, the Company will continue to refine itscontingency plans during the fourth quarter. The costs of the project and the date on which the Company plansto complete the Year Readiness program are based on management\'sbest estimates, which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions offuture events including the continued availability of certainresources, third party modification plans and other factors. Eventhough the Company has met all established deadlines and the costestimates have remained constant, actual results could differmaterially from these estimates. Specific factors that might causesuch material differences include, but are not limited to, theavailability and cost of personnel trained in this area, the abilityto locate and correct all relevant computer codes, the failure ofthird parties to be Year ready, and similar uncertainties.DALLAS LOVE FIELDIn , as part of an agreement between the cities of Fort Worth andDallas to build and operate DallasFort Worth Airport (DFW), a bondordinance was enacted by both cities (the Bond Ordinance). The BondOrdinance required both cities to direct all scheduled interstatepassenger operations to DFW and was an integral part of the bondsissued for the construction and operation of DFW. In , as part ofa settlement to resolve litigation with Southwest Airlines, the citiesagreed to expand the scope of operations allowed under the BondOrdinance at Dallas\' Love Field. Congress enacted the WrightAmendment to prevent the federal government from acting inconsistentwith this agreement. The Wright Amendment limited interstateoperations at Love Field to the four states contiguous to Texas (NewMexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana) and prohibited throughticketing to any destination outside that perimeter. In , withoutthe consent of either city, Congress amended the Wright Amendment by(i) adding three states (Kansas, Mississippi and Alabama) to theperimeter and (ii) removing some federal restrictions on largeaircraft configured with seats or less (the Amendment). InOctober , the City of Fort Worth filed suit in state districtcourt against the City of Dallas and others seeking to enforce theBond Ordinance. Fort Worth contends that the Amendment does notpreclude the City of Dallas from exercising its proprietary rights torestrict traffic at Love Field in a manner consistent with the BondOrdinance and, moreover, that Dallas has an obligation to do so.American joined in this litigation. On October , , the statedistrict court granted summary judgment in favor of Fort Worth andAmerican, which summary judgment is being appealed to the Fort WorthCourt of Appeals. In the same lawsuit, DFW filed claims alleging thatirrespective of whether the Bond Ordinance is enforceable, the DFW UseAgreement prohibits American and other DFW signatory airlines frommoving any interstate operations to Love Field. These claims remainunresolved. Dallas filed a separate declaratory judgment action infederal district court seeking to have the court declare that, as amatter of law, the Amendment precludes Dallas from exercising anyrestrictions on operations at Love Field. Further, in May ,Continental Airlines and Continental Express filed a lawsuit infederal court seeking a judicial declaration that the Bond Ordinancecannot be enforced to prevent them from operating flights from LoveField to Cleveland using regional jets. In December , theDepartment of Transportation (DOT) issued an order on the federal lawquestions concerning the Bond Ordinance, local proprietary powers,DFW\'s Use Agreement with DFW carriers such as American, and the Wrightand Amendments, and concluded that the Bond Ordinance waspreempted by federal law and was therefore, not enforceable. The DOTalso found that the DFW Use Agreement did not preclude American fromconducting interstate operations at Love Field. Fort Worth, Americanand DFW have appealed the DOT\'s order to the Fifth Circuit Court ofAppeals. As a result of the foregoing, the future of interstate flightoperations at Love Field and American\'s DFW hub are uncertain. Anincrease in operations at Love Field to new interstate destinationscould adversely impact American\'s business. --<PAGE> FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATIONStatements in this report contain various forward-looking statementswithin the meaning of Section A of the Securities Act of , asamended, and Section E of the Securities Exchange Act of , asamended, which represent the Company\'s expectations or beliefsconcerning future events.

The million decrease from to resulted primarily from a decrease in income from continuing operations. Capital expenditures in totaled . billion, compared to .billion in and . billion in , and included aircraft acquisitions ofapproximately . billion. In , American took delivery of Boeing-s, Boeing -IGWs, six Boeing -s and four Boeing -ERaircraft. AMR Eagle took delivery of Embraer ERJ-s and nine EmbraerERJ- aircraft. These expenditures, as well as the expansion of certainairport facilities, were funded primarily with internally generated cash, exceptfor (i) the Embraer aircraft acquisitions, which were funded through secureddebt agreements, (ii) Boeing aircraft, which were financed through securedmortgage agreements, and (iii) one Boeing - aircraft, which was financedthrough a sale-leaseback transaction. At December , , the Company had commitments to acquire thefollowing aircraft: Boeing -s, Boeing -IGWs, EmbraerERJ-s, five Embraer ERJ-s and Bombardier CRJ-s. Deliveries of allaircraft extend through . Future payments for all aircraft, including theestimated amounts for price escalation, will approximate . billion in ,. billion in , million in and an aggregate of approximately. billion in through . In addition to these commitments foraircraft, the Company expects to spend approximately . billion in formodifications to aircraft, renovations of -- and additions to -- airport andoff-airport facilities, and the acquisition of various other equipment andassets, of which approximately million has been authorized by the Company\'sBoard of Directors. The Company expects to fund its capital expendituresfrom the Company\'s existing cash and short-term investments, internallygenerated cash, and new financing depending upon capital market conditions andthe Company\'s evolving view of its long-term needs. For the year ended December , , the Company purchased approximately. million shares of its common stock under two separate share repurchaseprograms at a total cost of approximately million. Additional sharerepurchases of up to million, the remaining amount currently authorized bythe Company\'s Board of Directors, may be made from time to time, depending onmarket conditions, and may be discontinued at any time. At December , , the Company owned approximately . milliondepository certificates convertible, subject to certain restrictions, into thecommon stock of Equant, which completed an initial public offering in July .As of December , , the estimated fair value of these depositorycertificates was approximately million, based upon the publicly tradedmarket value of Equant common stock. Of the . million depository certificatesowned by the Company as of December , , approximately . milliondepository certificates, with an estimated market value of approximately million, are held by the Company on behalf of Sabre. On February , , the Company declared its intent to distribute AMR\'sentire ownership interest in Sabre as a dividend on all outstanding shares ofits common stock. To effect the dividend, AMR exchanged all of its ,,shares of Sabre\'s Class B common stock for an equal number of shares of Sabre\'sClass A common stock. Effective after the close of business on March , ,AMR distributed . shares of Sabre Class A common stock for each share ofAMR stock owned by AMR\'s shareholders. The record date for the dividend of Sabrestock was the close of business on March , . In addition, on February ,, Sabre paid a special one-time cash dividend of million toshareholders of record of Sabre common stock at the close of business onFebruary , . Based upon its approximate percent interest in Sabre, AMRreceived approximately million of this dividend. These funds will be usedfor general corporate purposes. The dividend of AMR\'s entire ownership interestin Sabre\'s common stock resulted in a reduction to AMR\'s retained earnings inMarch of equal to the carrying value of the Company\'s investment in Sabreon March , , which approximated million. The fair market value ofAMR\'s investment in Sabre on March , , based upon the quoted marketclosing price of Sabre Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange, wasapproximately . billion. <PAGE> The Company\'s March , distribution of its ownership interest inSabre represented a designated event, as defined, under event risk covenantscontained in agreements related to certain indebtedness of the Company andAmerican. Under these covenants, the interest rate on such indebtedness will beincreased if, during a specified period following the occurrence of a designatedevent, the credit rating of such indebtedness is downgraded below certainlevels. However, the Company has not received indication that the credit ratingon any such indebtedness will be downgraded. For additional informationconcerning these event risk covenants, see Note to the consolidated financialstatements. American has a . billion credit facility agreement that expiresDecember , . At American\'s option, interest on the agreement can becalculated on one of several different bases. For most borrowings, Americanwould anticipate choosing a floating rate based upon the London InterbankOffered Rate (LIBOR). At December , , no borrowings were outstanding underthe agreement. AMR (principally American Airlines) historically operates with a workingcapital deficit as do most other airline companies. The existence of such adeficit has not in the past impaired the Company\'s ability to meet itsobligations as they become due and is not expected to do so in the future.OTHER INFORMATIONENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Subsidiaries of AMR have been notified of potentialliability with regard to several environmental cleanup sites and certain airportlocations. At sites where remedial litigation has commenced, potential liabilityis joint and several. AMR\'s alleged volumetric contributions at these sites areminimal. AMR does not expect these matters, individually or collectively, tohave a material impact on its results of operations, financial position orliquidity. Additional information is included in Note to the consolidatedfinancial statements.YEAR PROJECT The Company did not experience any significant malfunctions orerrors in its operating or business systems on January , , and has notsince that date. Although it is possible that the full impact of the date changehas not been fully recognized, the Company believes any such problems are likelyto be minor and correctable. In addition, the Company could still be negativelyaffected if its customers or major suppliers are adversely affected by the Year or similar issues. However, the Company is not currently aware of anysignificant Year or similar problems that have arisen for its customers ormajor suppliers. As of December , , the Company\'s total cost of the Year Project was approximately million. Costs associated with the Year Project were expensed as incurred, other than capitalized hardware costs, andwere funded through cash from operations.DALLAS LOVE FIELD In , as part of an agreement between the cities of FortWorth and Dallas to build and operate DallasFort Worth Airport (DFW), a bondordinance was enacted by both cities (the Bond Ordinance). The Bond Ordinancerequired both cities to direct all scheduled interstate passenger operations toDFW and was an integral part of the bonds issued for the construction andoperation of DFW. In , as part of a settlement to resolve litigation withSouthwest Airlines, the cities agreed to expand the scope of operations allowedunder the Bond Ordinance at Dallas\' Love Field. Congress enacted the WrightAmendment to prevent the federal government from acting inconsistent with thisagreement. The Wright Amendment limited interstate operations at Love Field tothe four states contiguous to Texas (New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, andLouisiana) and prohibited through ticketing to any destination outside thatperimeter. In , without the consent of either city, Congress amended theWright Amendment by (i) adding three states (Kansas, Mississippi, and Alabama)to the perimeter and (ii) removing some federal restrictions on large aircraftconfigured with seats or less (the Amendment). <PAGE> In October , the City of Fort Worth filed suit in state districtcourt against the City of Dallas and others seeking to enforce the BondOrdinance. Fort Worth contends that the Amendment does not preclude theCity of Dallas from exercising its proprietary rights to restrict traffic atLove Field in a manner consistent with the Bond Ordinance and, moreover, thatDallas has an obligation to do so. American joined in this litigation. OnOctober , , the state district court granted summary judgment in favor ofFort Worth and American, which summary judgment is being appealed to the FortWorth Court of Appeals. In the same lawsuit, DFW filed claims alleging thatirrespective of whether the Bond Ordinance is enforceable, the DFW Use Agreementprohibits American and other DFW signatory airlines from moving any interstateoperations to Love Field. These claims remain unresolved. Dallas filed a separate declaratory judgment action in the United StatesDistrict Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, seeking tohave the court declare that, as a matter of law, the Amendment precludesDallas from exercising any restrictions on operations at Love Field. Further, inMay , Continental Airlines and Continental Express filed a lawsuit in Dallasfederal court seeking a judicial declaration that the Bond Ordinance cannot beenforced to prevent them from operating flights from Love Field to Clevelandusing regional jets. These two federal court lawsuits were consolidated andstayed. In December , the Department of Transportation (DOT) issued an orderon the federal law questions concerning the Bond Ordinance, local proprietarypowers, DFW\'s Use Agreement with DFW carriers such as American, and the Wrightand Amendments, and concluded that the Bond Ordinance was preempted byfederal law and was therefore not enforceable. The DOT also found that the DFWUse Agreement did not preclude American from conducting interstate operations atLove Field. Fort Worth, American and DFW appealed the DOT\'s order to the FifthCircuit Court of Appeals, and on February , , the Fifth Circuit affirmedthe DOT\'s order in all respects. In January , the Department of Justice, at the behest of the DOT,filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District ofTexas, Dallas Division, against Fort Worth and American seeking to enforce theDOT\'s order and to prevent any party from interfering with any carrier operatingunder that order. American has announced new service from Love Field beginning May , ,to Chicago and Los Angeles and is seeking facilities at Love Field from Dallas.As a result of the foregoing, the future of interstate flight operations at LoveField and American\'s DFW hub are uncertain. An increase in operations at LoveField to new interstate destinations could adversely impact American\'s business.OUTLOOK FOR The Company is cautiously optimistic about the revenue environment. TheU.S. economy remains strong, and many of the world\'s economies are expected tocontinue to improve. Against this backdrop, the chief concerns are theindustry\'s ability to match capacity growth with the demand for air travel, andthe much higher fuel prices. For American, capacity is expected to increase onlyslightly in . The increase in American\'s seating capacity from the deliveryof new aircraft will be mostly offset by the removal of approximately ,seats from its fleet. (In February , the Company announced its ""More RoomThroughout Coach"" initiative, which will provide more room to passengersthroughout the coach cabins. American\'s entire fleet will be reconfigured toincrease the seat pitch from the present industry standard of and inchesto a predominant seat pitch of and inches.) Over the course of the year, the Company expects to strengthen itsposition in key domestic markets, while strategically expanding itsinternational network. Domestically, American and AMR Eagle look to continue tobenefit from the integration of Reno and Business Express, and the marketingrelationships with U.S. Airways, Inc. and Alaska Airlines, Inc. Internationally,while American will introduce minimal service increases, it will, whereappropriate, expand its various code-share alliances. Further, ONEworld willadmit two new partners in -- LanChile and Aer Lingus -- and, while losingCanadian Airlines, will look to otherwise buttress its position in Canada. <PAGE> Pressure to reduce costs will continue, although the volatility of fuelprices makes any prediction of overall costs very difficult. Excluding fuel, theCompany anticipates an increase in operating expenses of about five percent,driven primarily by higher labor costs associated with the normal seniority andscale increases in union contracts, an increase in depreciation and amortizationexpense and maintenance, materials and repairs expense as the Company continuesto acquire new aircraft, and an increase in airport landing fees and facilityrent expense from higher rates. Other expense lines will see volume-drivenincreases and inflationary pressures. Partially offsetting this expectedincrease in costs, the Company expects savings in commission expense due tochanges made in late to the commission structure, and a decrease in thepercentage of commissionable transactions. Overshadowing all other expenses, though, is the expected increase infuel expense, owing to significantly higher fuel prices. Although the Companyhas hedged approximately percent of its fuel requirements as of December, , its earnings will be adversely impacted by this significant risein fuel prices. The magnitude of this impact will be driven by the duration ofthe higher prices, which, at a minimum, will dampen the Company\'s first half financial results. In addition to the direct effect, the higher fuel pricesmay, if sustained at their current levels for an extended period of time,indirectly negatively impact the Company by slowing the economy and thereby thedemand for air travel.FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATIONThe preceding discussions under Business and Management\'s Discussion andAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain variousforward-looking statements within the meaning of Section A of the SecuritiesAct of , as amended, and Section E of the Securities Exchange Act of ,as amended, which represent the Company\'s expectations or beliefs concerningfuture events. When used in this document and in documents incorporated hereinby reference, the words ""expects,"" ""plans,"" ""anticipates,"" and similarexpressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-lookingstatements include, without limitation, expectations as to results of operationsand financial condition, including changes in capacity, revenues and costs,expectations as to future financing needs, Year expectations, overalleconomic projections and the Company\'s plans and objectives for futureoperations, including plans to develop future code-sharing programs and toevaluate new alliances. All forward-looking statements in this report are basedupon information available to the Company on the date of this report. TheCompany undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise anyforward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future eventsor otherwise. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of factors thatcould cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Thefollowing factors, in addition to other possible factors not listed, could causethe Company\'s actual results to differ materially from those expressed inforward-looking statements:UNCERTAINTY OF FUTURE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS AND EVENTS The Company\'soperations could be adversely affected by failure of the Company to reachagreement with any labor union representing the Company\'s employees or by anagreement with a labor union representing the Company\'s employees that containsterms which prevent the Company from competing effectively with other airlines.In addition, a dispute between the Company and an employee work group (outsidethe confines of a collective bargaining agreement) could adversely impact theCompany\'s operations.ECONOMIC AND OTHER CONDITIONS The airline industry is affected by changes ininternational, national, regional and local economic conditions, inflation, waror political instability (or the threat thereof), consumer preferences andspending patterns, demographic trends, disruptions to the air traffic controlsystem, consumer perceptions of airline safety, costs of safety, security andenvironmental measures, and the weather.COMMODITY PRICES Due to the competitive nature of the airline industry, in theevent of any increase in the price of jet fuel, there can be no assurance thatthe Company would be able to pass on increased fuel prices to its customers byincreasing fares. <PAGE> COMPETITION IN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY Service over almost all of the Company\'sroutes is highly competitive. The Company faces vigorous competition from majordomestic airlines, national, regional, all-cargo and charter carriers, foreigncarriers, low-cost carriers, and, particularly on shorter segments, groundtransportation. Pricing decisions are affected by competition from otherairlines. Fare discounting by competitors has historically had a negative effecton the Company\'s financial results because American is generally required tomatch competitors\' fares to maintain passenger traffic. No assurance can begiven that any future fare reduction would be offset by increases in passengertraffic, a reduction in costs or changes in the mix of traffic that wouldimprove yields.CHANGING BUSINESS STRATEGY Although it has no current plan to do so, the Companymay change its business strategy in the future and may not pursue some of thegoals stated herein.GOVERNMENT REGULATION Future results of the Company\'s operations may vary basedupon any actions which the governmental agencies with jurisdiction over theCompany\'s operations may take, including the granting and timing of certaingovernmental approvals (including foreign government approvals) needed forcode-sharing alliances and other arrangements with other airlines, restrictionson competitive practices (e.g., new regulations which would curtail an airline\'sability to respond to a competitor), the adoption of regulations that impactcustomer service standards, and the adoption of more restrictive locally-imposednoise restrictions.UNCERTAINTY IN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS The Company\'s current internationalactivities and prospects could be adversely affected by factors such asreversals or delays in the opening of foreign markets, exchange controls,currency and political risks, taxation and changes in international governmentregulation of the Company\'s operations. <PAGE> ITEM ']",,

The Bond Ordinance required both cities todirect all scheduled interstate passenger operations to DFW and was an integralpart of the bonds issued for the construction and operation of DFW. In , aspart of a settlement to resolve litigation with Southwest Airlines, the citiesagreed to expand the scope of operations allowed under the Bond Ordinance atDallas\' Love Field. Congress enacted the Wright Amendment to prevent the federalgovernment from acting inconsistent with this agreement. The Wright Amendmentlimited interstate operations at Love Field to the four states contiguous toTexas (New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana) and prohibited throughticketing to any destination outside that perimeter. In , without theconsent of either city, Congress amended the Wright Amendment by (i) addingthree states (Kansas, Mississippi, and Alabama) to the perimeter and (ii)removing some federal restrictions on large aircraft configured with seats orless (the Amendment). In October , the City of Fort Worth filed suit in state district courtagainst the City of Dallas and others seeking to enforce the Bond Ordinance.Fort Worth contended that the Amendment does not preclude the City ofDallas from exercising its proprietary rights to restrict traffic at Love Fieldin a manner consistent with the Bond Ordinance and, moreover, that Dallas has anobligation to do so. American joined in this litigation. On October , ,the state district court granted summary judgment in favor of American and FortWorth. On May , , the Fort Worth Court of Appeals overturned the districtcourt order and concluded that the Bond Ordinance was preempted by federal law.American and Fort Worth filed motions asking the Fort Worth Court of Appeals toreconsider its decision. In the same lawsuit, DFW filed claims alleging thatirrespective of whether the Bond Ordinance was enforceable, the DFW UseAgreement prohibited American and other DFW signatory airlines from moving anyinterstate operations to Love Field. Dallas filed a separate declaratory judgment action in the United StatesDistrict Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, seeking tohave the court declare that, as a matter of law, the Amendment precludesthe City of Dallas from exercising any restrictions on operations at Love Field.Further, in May , Continental Airlines and Continental Express filed alawsuit in Dallas federal court seeking a judicial declaration that the BondOrdinance cannot be enforced to prevent them from operating flights from LoveField to Cleveland using regional jets. These two federal court lawsuits wereconsolidated and stayed. --<PAGE> In December , the Department of Transportation (DOT) issued an order onthe federal law questions concerning the Bond Ordinance, local proprietarypowers, DFW\'s Use Agreement with DFW carriers such as American, and the Wrightand Amendments, and concluded that the Bond Ordinance was preempted byfederal law and was therefore not enforceable. The DOT also found that the DFWUse Agreement did not preclude American from conducting interstate operations atLove Field. Fort Worth, American and DFW appealed the DOT\'s order to the FifthCircuit Court of Appeals, and on February , , the Fifth Circuit affirmedthe DOT\'s order in all respects. American, Fort Worth and DFW each filedpetitions for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court, whichwere denied on June , . Shortly thereafter, American, Fort Worth and DFWdismissed all remaining motions and claims in the Texas state court litigation.Consequently, litigation over the right to provide scheduled passengeroperations at Love Field on aircraft with fewer than seats to destinationsbeyond the Wright Amendment perimeter has ended. In January , the Department of Justice, at the behest of the DOT, fileda lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District ofTexas, Dallas Division, against Fort Worth and American seeking to enforce theDOT\'s order and to prevent any party from interfering with any carrier operatingunder that order. On May , , American commenced service from Love Field to Chicago andLos Angeles using terminal space leased from Continental Express on a short-termbasis. American has further announced that it will offer service from Love Fieldto New York\'s LaGuardia airport commencing August , . American is seekinglong-term facilities at Love Field from the City of Dallas for its Love Fieldoperations. As a result of the foregoing, an increase in operations at LoveField andor the inability of American to obtain adequate facilities to competeeffectively at Love Field could adversely impact American\'s business.INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATIONTwo competitors of the Company, UAL Corporation and US Airways Group, Inc.,recently announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement.

The million increase from to resulted primarily from a decrease in working capital. Capital expenditures in totaled . billion, compared to .billion in and . billion in , and included aircraft acquisitions ofapproximately . billion. In , American took delivery of Boeing-s and Boeing -ERs. AMR Eagle took delivery of Embraer aircraft and five Embraer aircraft. These expenditures, as well as theexpansion of certain airport facilities, were funded primarily with internallygenerated cash and the million cash dividend from Sabre HoldingsCorporation, except for (i) Boeing aircraft which were financed throughsecured mortgage agreements, and (ii) the Embraer aircraft acquisitions whichwere funded through secured debt agreements. At December , , the Company had commitments to acquire thefollowing aircraft: Boeing -s, Boeing -s, Boeing-ERs, Embraer regional jets and Bombardier CRJ-s. Deliveries ofall aircraft extend through . Future payments for all aircraft, includingthe estimated amounts for price escalation, will approximate . billion in, . billion in , million in and an aggregate ofapproximately . billion in through . In addition to thesecommitments for aircraft, the Company expects to spend approximately .billion in for modifications to aircraft, renovations of - and additions to- - airport and off-airport facilities, and the acquisition of various otherequipment and assets, of which approximately million has been authorized bythe Company\'s Board of Directors. The Company expects to fund its capitalexpenditures from the Company\'s existing cash and short-term investments,internally generated cash or new financing depending upon market conditionsand the Company\'s evolving view of its long-term needs. <PAGE> On January , , the Company announced three transactions that areexpected to substantially increase the scope of its existing network. First, theCompany announced that it had agreed to purchase substantially all of the assetsof Trans World Airlines, Inc. (TWA) for approximately million in cash andto assume approximately . billion of TWA\'s obligations. The Company\'sagreement with TWA contemplated that TWA would file for bankruptcy protectionunder Chapter of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and conduct an auction of itsassets under the auspices of the Bankruptcy Court. During the auction, othercredible offers would compete with the Company\'s offer. TWA filed for bankruptcyprotection on January , . In conjunction therewith, the Company alsoagreed to provide TWA with up to million in debtor-in-possession financingto facilitate TWA\'s ability to maintain its operations until the completion ofthis transaction. The amount available under this facility was later increasedto million. As of March , , approximately million had beenprovided via the debtor-in-possession financing. The auction of TWA\'s assets was commenced on March , , and recessedto March , . During the recess, the Company increased its cash bid to million and agreed to leave in the TWA estate certain aircraft securitydeposits, advance rental payments and rental rebates that were estimated tobring approximately million of value to TWA. The Company expects that theincrease in the Company\'s bid will be more than offset, however, by the benefitto the Company of the reductions in rental rates the Company has negotiated withTWA\'s aircraft lessors. On March , , TWA\'s board selected theCompany\'s bid as the ""highest and best"" offer, and on March , , the U.S.Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware, entered an order approving the sale ofTWA\'s assets to the Company. Consummation of the transaction is subject toseveral contingencies, including the waiver by TWA\'s unions of certainprovisions of their collective bargaining agreements. The approval of the U.S.Department of Justice was obtained on March , . Certain parties havefiled appeals of the Bankruptcy Court\'s sale order, and have sought a stay ofthe transaction, pending the appeals. A provision of the Bankruptcy Code willpermit the Company to close the transaction, despite pending appeals, unless astay is granted. If a stay is granted, the Company would anticipate that theappeal process would be expedited. Upon the closing of the transaction, TWA willbe integrated into American\'s operations with a continued hub operation in St.Louis. The Company expects to fund the acquisition of TWA\'s assets with itsexisting cash or short-term investments, internally generated cash or newfinancing depending on market conditions and the Company\'s evolving view of itslong-term needs. Secondly, the Company announced that it has agreed to acquire from UnitedAirlines, Inc. (United) certain key strategic assets (slots, gates and aircraft)of US Airways, Inc. (US Airways) upon the consummation of the previouslyannounced merger between United and US Airways. In addition to the acquisitionof these assets, American will lease a number of slots and gates from United sothat American may operate half of the northeast Shuttle (New YorkWashingtonDCBoston). United will operate the other half of the Shuttle. For these assets,American will pay approximately . billion in cash to United and assumeapproximately million in aircraft operating leases. The consummation ofthese transactions is contingent upon the closing of the proposed UnitedUSAirways merger. Also, the acquisition of aircraft is generally dependent upon acertain number of US Airways\' Boeing cockpit crew members transferring toAmerican\'s payroll. Finally, American has agreed to acquire a percent stake in, and toenter into an exclusive marketing agreement with, DC Air LLC (DC Air). Americanhas agreed to pay million in cash for its ownership stake. American willhave a right of first refusal on the acquisition of the remaining percentstake in DC Air. American will also lease to DC Air a certain number of Fokker aircraft with necessary crews (known in the industry as a ""wet lease"").These wet leased aircraft will be used by DC Air in its operations. DC Air isthe first significant new entrant at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport(DCA) in over a decade. DC Air will acquire the assets needed to begin its DCAoperations from UnitedUS Airways upon the consummation of the merger betweenthe two carriers. American\'s investment in DC Air and the other arrangementsdescribed above are contingent upon the consummation of the merger betweenUnited and US Airways. American has . billion in credit facility agreements that expireDecember , , subject to certain conditions. At American\'s option, intereston these agreements can be calculated on one of several different bases. Formost borrowings, American would anticipate choosing a floating rate based uponthe London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). At December , , no borrowingswere outstanding under these agreements. <PAGE> AMR (principally American Airlines) historically operates with a workingcapital deficit as do most other airline companies. The existence of such adeficit has not in the past impaired the Company\'s ability to meet itsobligations as they become due and is not expected to do so in the future.OTHER INFORMATIONENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Subsidiaries of AMR have been notified of potentialliability with regard to several environmental cleanup sites and certain airportlocations. At sites where remedial litigation has commenced, potential liabilityis joint and several. AMR\'s alleged volumetric contributions at these sites areminimal compared to others. AMR does not expect these matters, individually orcollectively, to have a material impact on its results of operations, financialposition or liquidity. Additional information is included in Note to theconsolidated financial statements.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement ofFinancial Accounting Standards No. , ""Accounting for Derivative Instrumentsand Hedging Activities"", as amended (SFAS ), was adopted by the Company onJanuary , . SFAS requires the Company to recognize all derivatives onthe balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must beadjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, dependingon the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives will eitherbe offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, orfirm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive incomeuntil the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of aderivative\'s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.The adoption of SFAS did not have a material impact on the Company\'s netearnings. However, the Company recorded a transition adjustment of approximately million in accumulated other comprehensive income in the first quarter of.OUTLOOK FOR The Company is cautious in its outlook for . On the revenue front, theprimary concern is a slowing U.S. economy. American\'s strong revenue performancethe past several years was marked by a growing U.S. economy coupled with amodest increase in industry capacity. Our revenue performance in will bedictated by how well the industry manages that relationship going forward. Absent the TWA, UnitedUS Airways and DC Air transactions, American\'scapacity in is expected to grow about three percent, slightly less than theindustry average. AMR Eagle\'s capacity will grow about percent, reflectingthe delivery of new regional jets (RJs). Should the demand for air travelslow more quickly than expected, both carriers have the flexibility to furtheraccelerate the retirement of certain older aircraft to keep the Company\'scapacity growth in line with general economic conditions. With the transactions, if approved, the Company expects to strengthen itsposition in several key domestic markets. The TWA transaction will provideAmerican with a hub operation in St. Louis which will serve to strengthen theCompany\'s position as an eastwest carrier. In addition, these proposedtransactions will allow the Company to gain additional slots and real estate atNew York\'s Kennedy and LaGuardia airports, Washington Reagan, Boston and othermajor airports across the domestic system. At the same time, the Company willcontinue to improve the regional airline feed to American by strengthening AMREagle with the replacement of turboprop aircraft with RJs and the expansion ofconnecting service at Chicago O\'Hare, DFW and key East Coast cities. The Companyhas reached agreements with three regional carriers feeding TWA in St. Louis.These agreements will provide for continued feed traffic from St. Louis shouldthe TWA transaction be approved. On the international front, the Company will continue to pursue itsrelationship with SwissairSabena, and its bilateral agreement with EVA ofTaiwan -- coupled with the Company\'s existing Asian carrier alliances -- willallow the Company to strengthen its presence in several Asian markets. TheCompany is also working to make the ONEworld alliance pay off in moresignificant ways, in part by strengthening its relationship with BritishAirways. <PAGE> Pressure to reduce costs will continue, although the volatility of fuelprices makes any prediction of overall costs very difficult. Excluding fuelexpense and the impact of the Company\'s More Room Throughout Coach program, theCompany anticipates an increase in unit cost of one to two percent drivenprimarily by higher labor and aircraft ownership costs. On the labor front, theCompany has or will have all three of its union contracts open for negotiationin . The expected result is upward pressure on labor rates. Aircraftdepreciation and maintenance, materials and repairs expense will also be up,reflecting and aircraft deliveries. Other expense lines will seevolume-driven increases and inflationary pressures. Partially offsetting theseexpected increases, the Company anticipates future reductions in distributioncosts due to reduced commission expense and increased penetration rates forelectronic tickets. And although oil prices are largely expected to decrease in as compared to levels, the resulting benefit will be offset by lowerfuel hedging gains in from the Company\'s fuel hedging program. Lastly, as a result of the proposed TWA, UnitedUS Airways and DC Airtransactions, and for several other reasons, American and American Eagle haveinitiated an impairment review of certain fleet types in accordance withStatement of Financial Accounting Standards No. , ""Accounting for theImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of.""This review could result in an impairment charge to be taken by the Company in. The size of any resulting charge is not presently known, but may besignificant.FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATIONThe preceding discussions under Business, Properties, Legal Proceedings andManagement\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations contain various forward-looking statements within the meaning ofSection A of the Securities Act of , as amended, and Section E of theSecurities Exchange Act of , as amended, which represent the Company\'sexpectations or beliefs concerning future events. When used in this document andin documents incorporated herein by reference, the words ""expects,"" ""plans,""""anticipates,"" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-lookingstatements. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, expectationsas to results of operations and financial condition, including changes incapacity, revenues and costs, expectations as to future financing needs, overalleconomic projections and the Company\'s plans and objectives for futureoperations, including its ability to successfully integrate into its operationsassets the Company may acquire in its previously announced transactions withTWA, UnitedUS Airways and DC Air, and plans to develop future code-sharingprograms and to evaluate new alliances. All forward-looking statements in thisreport are based upon information available to the Company on the date of thisreport. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise anyforward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future eventsor otherwise. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of factors thatcould cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Thefollowing factors, in addition to other possible factors not listed, could causethe Company\'s actual results to differ materially from those expressed inforward-looking statements:UNCERTAINTY OF FUTURE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS AND EVENTS The Company\'soperations could be adversely affected by failure of the Company to reachagreement with any labor union representing the Company\'s employees or by anagreement with a labor union representing the Company\'s employees that containsterms which prevent the Company from competing effectively with other airlines.In addition, a dispute between the Company and an employee work group (outsidethe confines of a collective bargaining agreement) could adversely impact theCompany\'s operations.ECONOMIC AND OTHER CONDITIONS The airline industry is affected by changes ininternational, national, regional and local economic conditions, inflation, waror political instability (or the threat thereof), consumer preferences andspending patterns, demographic trends, disruptions to the air traffic controlsystem, consumer perceptions of airline safety, costs of safety, security andenvironmental measures, and the weather.COMMODITY PRICES Due to the competitive nature of the airline industry, in theevent of any increase in the price of jet fuel, there can be no assurance thatthe Company would be able to pass on increased fuel prices to its customers byincreasing fares. <PAGE> COMPETITION IN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY Service over almost all of the Company\'sroutes is highly competitive. The Company faces vigorous competition from majordomestic airlines, national, regional, all-cargo and charter carriers, foreigncarriers, low-cost carriers, and, particularly on shorter segments, groundtransportation. Pricing decisions are affected by competition from otherairlines. Fare discounting by competitors has historically had a negative effecton the Company\'s financial results because American is generally required tomatch competitors\' fares to maintain passenger traffic. No assurance can begiven that any future fare reduction would be offset by increases in passengertraffic, a reduction in costs or changes in the mix of traffic that wouldimprove yields.CHANGING BUSINESS STRATEGY Although it has no current plan to do so, the Companymay change its business strategy in the future and may not pursue some of thegoals stated herein.GOVERNMENT REGULATION Future results of the Company\'s operations may vary basedupon any actions which the governmental agencies with jurisdiction over theCompany\'s operations may take, including the granting and timing of certaingovernmental approvals (including foreign government approvals) needed forcode-sharing alliances and other arrangements with other airlines, restrictionson competitive practices (e.g., Court Orders, or Agency regulations or orders,that would curtail an airline\'s ability to respond to a competitor), theadoption of regulations that impact customer service standards, and the adoptionof more restrictive locally-imposed noise restrictions.UNCERTAINTY IN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS The Company\'s current internationalactivities and prospects could be adversely affected by factors such asreversals or delays in the opening of foreign markets, exchange controls,currency and political risks, taxation and changes in international governmentregulation of the Company\'s operations.INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION The Company has announced a series of transactions withTWA, UnitedUS Airways and DC Air (see page ). These transactions are subjectto a number of conditions and there can be no assurance that they will occur asplanned. If these transactions do not occur and yet other U.S. carriers merge orcreate or expand marketing alliances, such mergers or new or expanded marketingalliances could adversely affect the Company. <PAGE> ITEM ']",,

The Companyexpects to fund its remaining capital expenditures from the Company\'sexisting cash and short-term investments, internally generated cash or newfinancing depending upon market conditions and the Company\'s evolving view ofits long-term needs.OTHER INFORMATIONOn January , , the Company announced three transactions that wouldsubstantially increase the scope of its existing network. The first of thesetransactions was consummated on April , when the Company purchasedsubstantially all of the assets of TWA for approximately million in cash(subject to certain working capital adjustments), including the satisfaction of million in debtor-in-possession financing, and assumed certain liabilities.The Company funded the acquisition of TWA\'s assets with its existing cash andshort-term investments. The Company does not expect the acquisition of TWA tohave a significantly accretive or dilutive impact on the Company\'s earnings. Although TWA has historically reported net losses and the acquisitionof TWA will result in the incurrence of integration costs, the Company expectsto realize certain synergies from the acquisition, including, among otherthings, improved passenger revenues and a reduction in rental expense from therenegotiated lease obligations. Secondly, the Company announced that it has agreed to acquire from UnitedAirlines, Inc. (United) certain key strategic assets (slots, gates and aircraft)of US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways) upon the consummation of the previouslyannounced merger between United and US Airways. In addition to the acquisitionof these assets, American will lease a number of slots and gates from United sothat American may operate half of the northeast Shuttle (New YorkWashingtonDCBoston).

The consummation ofthese transactions is contingent upon the closing of the proposed UnitedUSAirways merger, which is no longer expected to occur in the second quarter of. Also, the acquisition of aircraft is dependent upon certain rights ofUnited to exclude aircraft from the transactions and also is generally dependentupon a certain number of US Airways\' Boeing cockpit crew memberstransferring to American\'s payroll. Finally, American has agreed to acquire a percent stake in, and to enterinto an exclusive marketing agreement with, D.C. Air, LLC (DC Air).

Capital expenditures for the first six months of were . billion, and included the acquisition of Boeing -s, eight Boeing -ERs, four Boeing -s, seven Embraer aircraft, six Embraer aircraft, and the purchase of McDonnell Douglas MD- aircraft previously leased by TWA. Thesecapital expenditures were financed primarily through secured mortgageand debt agreements. On April , , the Company purchasedsubstantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities ofTWA for approximately million, which was funded from theCompany\'s existing cash and short-term investments. The millionincludes the million purchase price paid to TWA and variousother acquisition costs, primarily the purchase of aircraft securitydeposits and prepaid rent. Proceeds from the sale of equipment andproperty of million included the proceeds received upon thedelivery of three McDonnell Douglas MD- aircraft to FederalExpress. As of June , , the Company had commitments to acquire thefollowing aircraft: Boeing -s, Boeing -s, Boeing-ERs, Boeing -ERs, Embraer regional jets and Bombardier CRJ-s. Deliveries of all aircraft continue through. Payments for all aircraft will approximate . billion duringthe remainder of , . billion in , . billion in andan aggregate of approximately . billion in through . TheCompany expects to fund its remaining capital expenditures fromthe Company\'s existing cash and short-term investments, internallygenerated cash and new financing depending upon market conditions andthe Company\'s evolving view of its long-term needs. The Company announced in January that it had agreed to acquireor lease from United Airlines, Inc. (United) certain key strategicassets (slots, gates and aircraft) of US Airways Group, Inc. (USAirways) and to jointly operate the northeast Shuttle (NewYorkWashingtonBoston) with United upon the consummation of thepreviously announced merger between United and US Airways. Inaddition, American announced that it had agreed to acquire a percent stake in, and to enter into an exclusive marketing agreementwith, D.C. Air, LLC (D.C. Air). --<Page> On July , , United and US Airways announced that they hadagreed to terminate the merger agreement between them. Upontermination of that merger agreement, the agreement between Americanand United automatically terminated. In addition, as the transactionsbetween American and D.C. Air were contingent upon the closing of theUnited-US Airways merger, the transactions between American and D.C.Air discussed above will not be consummated.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSIn July , the Financial Accounting Standards Board issuedStatements of Financial Accounting Standards No. , ""BusinessCombinations"" (SFAS ) and No. , ""Goodwill and Other IntangibleAssets"" (SFAS ). SFAS prohibits the use of the pooling-of-interests method for business combinations initiated after June , and includes criteria for the recognition of intangible assetsseparately from goodwill. SFAS includes the requirement to testgoodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment ratherthan amortize them. The Company will adopt SFAS in the firstquarter of , and currently estimates discontinuing theamortization of approximately million on an annualized basis. TheCompany is currently evaluating what additional impact these newaccounting standards may have on the Company\'s financial position orresults of operations.OUTLOOK FOR The Company expects the soft revenue environment experienced duringthe first half of the year to continue throughout the remainder of. In addition, the Company expects to see significantly higherlabor costs, given recent industry trends and American\'s recentlynegotiated tentative agreements with its flight attendants andmechanics. In response to the resulting earnings pressure, coupledwith the continued uncertainty surrounding fuel costs, the Company hasannounced that it has or will (i) retire aircraft earlier thanplanned, including the retirement of its entire fleet of McDonnellDouglas DC- aircraft by the first quarter of , (ii) adjustcapacity in certain markets by either reducing the size of theaircraft flown or reducing the number of frequencies operated, (iii)opt to not exercise certain aircraft purchase rights, (iv) implement amanagement and support staff hiring freeze, (v) reduce discretionaryoperating expenses where possible, and (vi) reduce or delay long-termcapital spending projects and freeze all discretionary capitalspending. Notwithstanding these actions, if current economicconditions persist, the Company expects to incur a loss for the thirdquarter and full year .FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATIONStatements in this report contain various forward-looking statementswithin the meaning of Section A of the Securities Act of , asamended, and Section E of the Securities Exchange Act of , asamended, which represent the Company\'s expectations or beliefsconcerning future events.

On September ,, two of American\'s aircraft were hijacked and destroyed interrorist attacks on The World Trade Center in New York City and thePentagon in northern Virginia. On the same day, two United Air Linesaircraft were also hijacked and used in terrorist attacks. Inresponse to the terrorist attacks, the Federal AviationAdministration (FAA) issued a federal ground stop order on September, , prohibiting all flights to, from, and within the UnitedStates. Airports did not reopen until September , (except forWashington Reagan National Airport, which was partially reopened onOctober , ). The Company was able to operate only a portion ofits scheduled flights for several days thereafter.

The Company will continue to evaluatewhether any additional provisions andor revisions to the chargesrecorded as of September , are required during the fourthquarter of (see further discussion in footnote to thecondensed consolidated financial statements). U.S. Government grantrepresents the reimbursement for direct and incremental costsresulting from the terrorist attacks, including impairment chargesand lost revenues, recognized by the Company in the third quarter of relating to the Air Transportation Safety and SystemStabilization Act (see further discussion in footnote to thecondensed consolidated financial statements).Other income (expense), historically a net expense, increased million due primarily to a decrease of million in interest incomeresulting from lower investment balances throughout most of the yearand a decrease of million in miscellaneous-net. The latterreflects the million gain in the second quarter of on thesale of the Company\'s warrants to purchase . million shares ofpriceline common stock versus a million gain during the secondquarter of from the settlement of a legal matter related to theCompany\'s labor disruption, offset by the write-down of certaininvestments held by the Company during . --<Page> RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)<Table><Caption>OPERATING STATISTICS Nine Months Ended September , <s> <c> <c>American Airlines Revenue passenger miles (millions) , , Available seat miles (millions) , , Cargo ton miles (millions) , , Passenger load factor . .

Capital expenditures for thefirst nine months of were . billion, and included theacquisition of Boeing -s, Boeing -ERs, eight Boeing-s, eight Embraer s, seven Embraer s, six Embraer aircraft, and the purchase of McDonnell Douglas MD- aircraftpreviously leased by TWA. These capital expenditures were financedprimarily through secured mortgage and debt agreements. Four Boeing- aircraft were financed through sale-leaseback transactions.On April , , the Company purchased substantially all of theassets and assumed certain liabilities of TWA for approximately million, which was funded from the Company\'s existing cash and short-term investments. The million includes the millionpurchase price paid to TWA and various other acquisition costs,primarily the purchase of aircraft security deposits and prepaidrent. Proceeds from the sale of equipment and property of million included the proceeds received upon the delivery of fourMcDonnell Douglas MD- aircraft to Federal Express. --<Page> As of September , , the Company had commitments to acquirethe following aircraft: Boeing -s, Boeing -ERs, Boeing -s, Boeing -ERs, Embraer regional jets and Bombardier CRJ-s. Future payments for all aircraft, includingthe estimated amounts for price escalation, will approximate million during the remainder of , . billion in , million in and an aggregate of approximately . billion in and beyond. These cash flows reflect a tentative agreement the Companyhas with Boeing to defer of its deliveries to and beyond.As the Company and Boeing are still negotiating the final terms of thetentative agreement, the above aircraft commitment and cash flow amountscould change. The Company has available a variety of future financing sources,including, but not limited to: (i) the receipt of the remainder of theU.S. Government grant, which approximates million, (ii)additional secured aircraft debt agreements, including the issuanceof approximately . billion of enhanced equipment trustcertificates, with million received at closing and the remainderto be received as aircraft are delivered, (iii) sale-leasebacktransactions of owned property, including aircraft and real estate,(iv) securitization of future operating receipts, (v) unsecuredborrowings, and (vi) federal loan guarantees as provided under the Actand other types of secured debt agreements. No assurance can be giventhat any of these financing sources will be available on terms acceptableto the Company. As of September , , the Company is in compliance with the twofinancial covenants contained in the Company\'s credit facility agreements.However, it is likely that a significant loss in the fourth quarterof could cause the Company to violate one or both covenants,unless they are modified. American is currently pursuing such modificationsto the agreements so that the Company will remain in compliance with thecovenants. Absent such modification, the million currently outstandingunder the credit facility agreements could become due and payable inlate first quarter . Subsequent to the September , events, Standard & Poor\'sdowngraded the senior unsecured credit rating of American from BBB- toBB and Moody\'s downgraded the senior unsecured credit rating ofAmerican from Baa to Ba. The long-term corporate credit ratings ofAmerican remain on Standard & Poor\'s CreditWatch with negativeimplications and Moody\'s has retained the credit ratings of Americanon review for possible downgrade. The impact of the terrorist attacks of September , and theiraftermath on the Company and the sufficiency of its financialresources to absorb that impact will depend on a number of factors,including: (i) the magnitude and duration of the adverse impact of theterrorist attacks on the economy in general, and the airline industryin particular; (ii) the Company\'s ability to reduce its operatingcosts and conserve its financial resources, taking into account theincreased costs it will incur as a consequence of the attacks,including those referred to below; (iii) the higher costs associatedwith new airline security directives and any other increasedregulation of air carriers; (iv) the significantly higher costs ofaircraft insurance coverage for future claims caused by acts of war,terrorism, sabotage, hijacking and other similar perils, and theextent to which such insurance will continue to be available; (v) theCompany\'s ability to raise additional financing; (vi) the price andavailability of jet fuel, and the availability to the Company of fuelhedges in light of current industry conditions; (vii) the number ofcrew members who may be called for duty in the reserve forces of thearmed services and the resulting impact on the Company\'s ability tooperate as planned; (viii) any resulting declines in the values of theaircraft in the Company\'s fleet and any aircraft or other assetimpairment charge, including routes, slots, gates and otherintangibles; (ix) the extent of the benefits received by the Companyunder the Act, taking into account any challenges to andinterpretations or amendments of the Act or regulations issuedpursuant thereto; and (x) the Company\'s ability to retain itsmanagement and other employees in light of current industry conditionsand their impact on compensation and morale. At this point, due in part to the lack of predictability of futuretraffic, business mix and yields, the Company is unable to fullyestimate the impact on it of the events of September , andtheir consequences and the sufficiency of its financial resources toabsorb that impact, including the mitigating effects of the Act andthe Company\'s aggressive actions to reduce its costs. However, giventhe magnitude of these unprecedented events and the possiblesubsequent effects, the Company expects that the adverse impact to theCompany\'s financial condition, its operations and its prospects willbe material and could be highly material. --<Page> FOURTH QUARTER OUTLOOKCapacity for American and TWA combined will be down about percentfrom last year\'s levels. Eagle capacity will be down about percent.Traffic for the fourth quarter is challenging to predict, if notimpossible. As of October , , advanced booking levels are down sixpoints in November and down four points in December, compared to the samedate and for the same periods last year. These numbers could increasehowever, as current trends show a higher than normal number of bookedpassengers not showing up for their flights. Yields may decline moresteeply in the fourth quarter than in the third, owing to more - anddeeper - fare sales and a weaker mix of business traffic. AMR unitcosts are expected to come in about two percent higher than last year- at . cents - despite a percent cut in capacity. This is duein large part to the numerous cost reduction initiatives the Companyput in place in response to the September terrorist attacks -cutting capacity and grounding aircraft, sharply reducing capitalspending, closing facilities, trimming food service and reducing itsworkforce. In addition, the Company expects to see lower fuel prices.Somewhat offsetting these cost savings will be higher security costs,higher insurance premiums and greater interest expense.Notwithstanding the cost savings initiatives, the Company is not ablein the short term to reduce its costs commensurate with its capacity(and revenue). As a result, the Company expects to incur asignificant loss in the fourth quarter, as well as for the full year.SPECIAL RISK FACTORNegative Impact of Terrorist Attacks Among the effects experiencedby the Company from the September , terrorist attacks have beensignificant flight disruption costs caused by the FAA\'s imposedgrounding of the U.S. airline industry\'s fleet, significantlyincreased security and other costs, significantly higher ticketrefunds, significantly reduced load factors, and significantly reducedyields. Further terrorist attacks using commercial aircraft in flightcould result in another grounding of the Company\'s fleet, and wouldlikely result in significant reductions in load factor and yields,along with increased ticket refund, security and other costs. Inaddition, terrorist attacks not involving commercial aircraft, or thegeneral increase in hostilities relating to reprisals againstterrorist organizations or otherwise, could result in decreased loadfactors and yields for airlines, including the Company, and could alsoresult in increased costs.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSIn July , the Financial Accounting Standards Board issuedStatements of Financial Accounting Standards No. , ""BusinessCombinations"" (SFAS ) and No. , ""Goodwill and Other IntangibleAssets"" (SFAS ). SFAS prohibits the use of the pooling-of-interests method for business combinations initiated after June , and includes criteria for the recognition of intangible assetsseparately from goodwill. SFAS includes the requirement to testgoodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment ratherthan amortize them. The Company will adopt SFAS in the firstquarter of , and currently estimates discontinuing theamortization of approximately million on an annualized basis. TheCompany is currently evaluating what additional impact these newaccounting standards may have on the Company\'s financial position orresults of operations. However, with the decline in the Company\'smarket capitalization, in part due to the terrorist attacks onSeptember , the adoption of SFAS might result in the write-off or write-down of the Company\'s goodwill. --<Page> FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATIONStatements in this report contain various forward-looking statementswithin the meaning of Section A of the Securities Act of , asamended, and Section E of the Securities Exchange Act of , asamended, which represent the Company\'s expectations or beliefsconcerning future events.

106,106,"['ITEM . MANAGEMENT\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AMR Corporation (AMR or the Company) was incorporated in October .AMR\'s principal subsidiary, American Airlines, Inc., was founded in . OnApril , , American Airlines, Inc. purchased substantially all of theassets and assumed certain liabilities of Trans World Airlines, Inc. (TWA).Accordingly, the operating results of TWA since the date of acquisition havebeen included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the yearended December , (see Note to the consolidated financial statements).American Airlines, Inc., including TWA (collectively, American), is the largestscheduled passenger airline in the world. AMR\'s operations fall almost entirelyin the airline industry.RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AMR\'s net loss in was . billion, or . loss per share. AMR\'snet earnings in were million, or . per share (. diluted). OnSeptember , , two American Airlines aircraft were hijacked and destroyedin terrorist attacks on The World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagonin northern Virginia. On the same day, two United Air Lines aircraft were alsohijacked and used in terrorist attacks. In response to the terrorist attacks,the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a federal ground stop order onSeptember , , prohibiting all flights to, from, and within the UnitedStates. Airports did not reopen until September , (except for WashingtonReagan Airport, which was partially reopened on October , ). The Companywas able to operate only a portion of its scheduled flights for several daysthereafter. When flights were permitted to resume, passenger traffic and yieldson the Company\'s flights were significantly lower than prior to the attacks. Asa result, the Company reduced its operating schedule to approximately percentof the schedule it flew prior to September , . Somewhat offsetting theimpact of the September events, the Company recorded million inreimbursement from the U.S. Government under the Air Transportation Safety andSystem Stabilization Act (the Act) (see Note to the consolidated financialstatements).REVENUES COMPARED TO The Company\'s revenues, yield, revenue passengermiles (RPMs) and available seat miles (ASMs) were severely impacted by theSeptember , terrorist attacks, the Company\'s reduced operating schedule,a worsening of the U.S. economy that had already been dampening the demand fortravel both domestically and internationally prior to the September , events, business travel declines as a result of the September , attacks,and increased fare sale activity occurring subsequent to the September attacks to encourage passengers to resume flying. The Company\'s revenuesdecreased approximately million, or . percent, versus . However,excluding TWA\'s revenues for the period April , through December ,, the Company\'s revenues would have decreased approximately . billionversus . For comparability purposes, the following discussion does not combineAmerican\'s and TWA\'s results of operations or related statistics for .American\'s passenger revenues decreased by percent, or . billion. In ,American derived approximately percent of its passenger revenues fromdomestic operations and approximately percent from international operations.American\'s domestic revenue per available seat mile (RASM) decreased .percent, to . cents, on a capacity decrease of percent, or billionASMs. International RASM decreased to . cents, or . percent, on a capacitydecrease of . percent. The decrease in international RASM was led by an .percent and . percent decrease in Pacific and European RASM, respectively,slightly offset by a . percent increase in Latin American RASM. The decreasein international capacity was driven by a . percent and . percent reductionin Latin American and European ASMs, respectively, partially offset by anincrease in Pacific capacity of . percent. TWA\'s passenger revenues were approximately . billion for the periodApril , through December , . TWA\'s RASM was . cents on capacityof . billion ASMs. <PAGE> AMR Eagle\'s passenger revenues decreased million, or . percent. AMREagle\'s traffic remained flat compared to , at . billion RPMs, whilecapacity increased to . billion ASMs, or . percent. Similar to American, thedecrease in AMR Eagle\'s revenues was due primarily to the September , terrorist attacks and a worsening of the U.S. economy that had already beendampening the demand for air travel prior to that date. Cargo revenues decreased . percent, or million, for the samereasons as noted above. COMPARED TO The Company\'s revenues increased approximately .billion, or . percent, versus . American\'s passenger revenues increasedby . percent, or . billion. The increase in revenues was due primarily toa strong U.S. economy, which led to strong demand for air travel bothdomestically and internationally, a favorable pricing climate, the impact of adomestic fuel surcharge implemented in January and increased in September, a labor disruption at one of the Company\'s competitors which positivelyimpacted the Company\'s revenues by approximately to million, and aschedule disruption which negatively impacted the Company\'s operations in .In , American derived approximately percent of its passenger revenuesfrom domestic operations and approximately percent from internationaloperations. American\'s domestic RASM increased . percent, to . cents, on acapacity decrease of . percent, or . billion ASMs. The decrease indomestic capacity was due primarily to the Company\'s More Room Throughout Coachprogram. International RASM increased to . cents, or . percent, on acapacity increase of . percent. The increase in international RASM was led bya . percent, . percent and . percent increase in Pacific, European andLatin American RASM, respectively. The increase in international capacity wasdriven by a . percent, . percent and . percent increase in European,Pacific and Latin American ASMs, respectively. AMR Eagle\'s passenger revenues increased million, or . percent.AMR Eagle\'s traffic increased to . billion RPMs, up . percent, whilecapacity increased to . billion ASMs, or . percent. The increase inrevenues was due primarily to growth in AMR Eagle capacity aided by a strongU.S. economy, which led to strong demand for air travel, and a favorable pricingenvironment. Cargo revenues increased . percent, or million, due primarily to afuel surcharge implemented in February and increased in October , andthe increase in cargo capacity from the addition of Boeing -ER aircraftin .OPERATING EXPENSES COMPARED TO The Company\'s operating expenses increased percent, orapproximately . billion. However, excluding TWA\'s expenses for the periodApril , through December , , the Company\'s expenses would haveincreased approximately million versus . In addition to the specificexplanations provided below, the significant decline in passenger trafficresulting from the terrorist acts of September , and resulting reducedoperating schedule caused a favorable impact on certain passenger-relatedoperating expenses, including aircraft fuel, other rentals and landing fees,commissions to agents and food service. American\'s cost per ASM increased .percent to . cents, excluding TWA and the impact of special charges - net ofU.S. Government grant. The increase in American\'s cost per ASM was drivenpartially by a reduction in ASMs due to the Company\'s More Room Throughout Coachprogram. Removing the impact of this program, American\'s cost per ASM grewapproximately . percent, excluding TWA and the impact of special charges - netof U.S. Government grant. TWA\'s cost per ASM, excluding the impact of specialcharges - net of U.S. Government grant, was . cents. Wages, salaries andbenefits increased . percent, or . billion, and included approximately million related to the addition of TWA. The remaining increase ofapproximately million related primarily to an increase in the averagenumber of equivalent employees and contractual wage rate and seniority increasesthat are built into the Company\'s labor contracts. During , the Companyrecorded approximately million in additional wages, salaries and benefitsrelated primarily to the Company\'s new contracts with its flight attendants andTransport Workers Union work groups. This was mostly offset by a milliondecrease in the provision for profit-sharing as compared to . Aircraft fuelexpense increased . percent, or million, and included approximately million related to the addition of TWA. The remaining increase in aircraft fuelexpense was due to a . percent increase in the Company\'s average price pergallon, partially offset by a . percent decrease in the Company\'s fuelconsumption, excluding TWA. Depreciation and amortization expense increased .percent, or million, due primarily to the addition of <PAGE>new aircraft and an increase of approximately million related to TWA. Otherrentals and landing fees increased million, or . percent, and includedapproximately million related to the addition of TWA. The remainingincrease of million was due primarily to higher facilities rent and landingfees across the Company\'s system. Commissions to agents decreased . percent,or million, and included approximately million related to TWA. Thedecrease in commissions to agents was due primarily to a . percent decreasein passenger revenues, excluding TWA, and the benefit from commission structurechanges implemented in . Aircraft rentals increased million, or .percent, due primarily to the addition of TWA aircraft. Other operating expensesincreased . percent, or million, and included approximately millionrelated to TWA. Special charges - net of U.S. Government grant included: (i) a million asset impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of related to the write-down of the carrying value of the Company\'s Fokker ,Saab and ATR- aircraft and related rotables, (ii) charges resulting fromthe September , terrorist events, including approximately millionrelated to aircraft charges, million in facility exit costs, million inemployee charges and million in other charges, and (iii) an millionbenefit recognized for the reimbursement from the U.S. Government under the Act.See a further discussion of special charges - net of U.S. Government grant inNote to the consolidated financial statements. COMPARED TO The Company\'s operating expenses increased . percent,or approximately . billion. American\'s cost per ASM increased by . percentto . cents, partially driven by a reduction in ASMs due to the Company\'sMore Room Throughout Coach program. Removing the impact of this program,American\'s cost per ASM grew approximately . percent. Wages, salaries andbenefits increased million, or . percent, primarily due to an increasein the average number of equivalent employees and contractual wage rate andseniority increases that are built into the Company\'s labor contracts, anincrease of approximately million in the provision for profit-sharing, and acharge of approximately million for the Company\'s employee home computerprogram. Aircraft fuel expense increased million, or . percent, due toan increase of . percent in the Company\'s average price per gallon and a .percent increase in the Company\'s fuel consumption. The increase in fuel expenseis net of gains of approximately million recognized during related tothe Company\'s fuel hedging program. Depreciation and amortization expenseincreased million, or . percent, due primarily to the addition of newaircraft, many of which replaced older aircraft. Maintenance, materials andrepairs expense increased million, or . percent, due primarily to anincrease in airframe and engine maintenance volumes at the Company\'s maintenancebases and an approximate million one-time credit the Company received in. Commissions to agents decreased . percent, or million, despite an. percent increase in passenger revenues, due primarily to commissionstructure changes implemented in October and January , and a decreasein the percentage of commissionable transactions.OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)Other income (expense) consists of interest income and expense, interestcapitalized and miscellaneous - net. COMPARED TO Interest income decreased million, or . percent,resulting from lower investment balances throughout most of . Interestexpense increased million, or . percent, resulting primarily from theincrease in long-term debt of approximately . billion. Miscellaneous - netdecreased million due primarily to including a million gain fromthe settlement of a legal matter related to the Company\'s labor disruption,offset by the write-down of certain investments held by the Company. Thiscompares to including a million gain on the sale of the Company\'swarrants to purchase . million shares of priceline.com Incorporated(priceline) common stock and a gain of approximately million from therecovery of start-up expenses from the Canadian Airlines International Limited(Canadian) services agreement. <PAGE> COMPARED TO Interest income increased million, or . percent,due primarily to higher investment balances. Interest expense increased million, or . percent, resulting primarily from financing new aircraftdeliveries.

Miscellaneous - netincreased million due primarily to a million gain on the sale of theCompany\'s warrants to purchase . million shares of priceline common stock anda gain of approximately million from the recovery of start-up expenses fromthe Canadian services agreement. During , the Company recorded a gain ofapproximately million from the sale of a portion of American\'s interest inEquant N.V. and a gain of approximately million related to the sale of theCompany\'s investment in the preferred stock of Canadian. These gains werepartially offset by the provision for the settlement of litigation items and thewrite-down of certain investments held by the Company during .OPERATING STATISTICSThe following table provides statistical information for American (excludingTWA) and AMR Eagle for the years ended December , , and .<Table><Caption> Year Ended December , ------------------------------------------------ ------------ ------------ ------------<S> <C> <C> <C>AMERICAN AIRLINES Revenue passenger miles (millions) , , , Available seat miles (millions) , , , Cargo ton miles (millions) , , , Passenger load factor . . .

Operating activities provided net cash of million in , .billion in and . billion in . The . billion decrease from to resulted primarily from a decrease in income. On April , , American purchased substantially all of the assets andassumed certain liabilities of TWA for approximately million, which wasfunded from the Company\'s existing cash and short-term investments. Capital expenditures in totaled . billion, compared to .billion in and . billion in . In , American took delivery of Boeing -s, Boeing -ERs and Boeing -s. AMR Eagle tookdelivery of Embraer s, seven Embraer s, six Embraer s and oneBombardier CRJ- aircraft. These expenditures were financed primarily throughsecured mortgage and debt agreements. Ten Boeing - aircraft were financedthrough sale-leaseback transactions, resulting in cash of approximately million being received by the Company. Proceeds from the sale of equipment andproperty and other investments of million included the proceeds receivedupon the delivery of five McDonnell Douglas MD- aircraft to FedEx. During the fourth quarter of , the Company reached an agreement withBoeing that included a combination of aircraft delivery deferrals, substitutionsand limited additional aircraft orders. As a direct result of the agreement withBoeing, the Company\'s and aircraft commitment amounts have beenreduced, in the aggregate, by approximately million. Following thisagreement, at December , , the Company had commitments to acquire thefollowing aircraft: Boeing -s, Boeing -ERs, nine Boeing-ERs, seven Boeing -s, Embraer regional jets and BombardierCRJ-s. Deliveries of all aircraft extend through . Future payments forall aircraft, including the estimated amounts for price escalation, willapproximate . billion in , . billion in , . billion in andan aggregate of approximately . billion in through . These futurepayments are net of approximately million related to deposits made for aircraft deliveries - which have been deferred as part of the agreement withBoeing - that will be applied to future aircraft deliveries. In addition tothese commitments for aircraft, the Company expects to spend approximately million in for modifications to aircraft, renovations of - and additions to- - airport and off-airport facilities, and the acquisition of various otherequipment and assets. During , American issued approximately . billion of enhancedequipment trust certificates which has been recorded as long-term debt. Theseenhanced equipment trust certificates are secured by aircraft, bear interest at. percent to . percent, and mature in to . Also during , asmentioned above, the Company entered into approximately . billion of variousdebt agreements secured by aircraft. Effective rates on these agreements arefixed or variable (based upon the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus aspread), ranging up to approximately . percent, and mature over variousperiods of time, ranging from to . American has an million credit facility that expires December ,. At American\'s option, interest on this facility can be calculated on oneof several different bases. For most borrowings, American would anticipatechoosing a floating rate based upon LIBOR. During the fourth quarter of ,American amended this credit facility to include, among other items, a revisionof its financial covenants, including modifications to its fixed charge covenantand the addition of certain liquidity requirements. The next test of the fixedcharge covenant will occur on June , and will consider only the precedingsix-month period. American secured the facility with previously unencumberedaircraft. In addition, the facility requires that American maintain at least. billion of liquidity, as defined in the facility, which consists primarilyof cash and short-term investments, and percent of the net book value of itsunencumbered aircraft. As of December , , million was outstandingunder this credit facility, at an interest rate of . percent. The interestrate on the entire credit facility will be reset on March , . <PAGE> In addition, American has available a billion credit facility thatexpires September , . Interest on this facility is based upon LIBOR plus aspread. This facility is immediately available subject to the Company providingspecified aircraft collateral as security at the time of borrowing. At December, , no borrowings were outstanding under this facility. Following the September , events, Standard & Poor\'s and Moody\'sdowngraded the credit ratings of AMR and American, and the credit ratings of anumber of other major airlines. The long-term corporate credit ratings of AMRand American were initially retained on review for possible downgrade byMoody\'s, and following subsequent downgrades, were given a negative outlook. Inaddition, the long-term corporate credit ratings of AMR and American remain onStandard & Poor\'s CreditWatch with negative implications. Any additionalreductions in AMR\'s or American\'s credit ratings could result in increasedborrowing costs to the Company and might limit the availability of futurefinancing sources. The following table summarizes the Company\'s obligations and commitmentsto be paid in and (in millions):<Table><Caption> Nature of commitment - ------------------------------------------------------- ------------ ------------<S> <C> <C> Operating lease payments for aircraft and facility obligations (*) , , Firm aircraft commitments , , Long-term debt (**) Capital lease obligations (**) ------------ ------------ Total obligations and commitments , , ============ ============<Table>(*) Certain special facility revenue bonds issued by municipalities - which are supported by operating leases executed by American - are guaranteed by AMR and American. See Note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.(**) Excludes related interest amounts In addition to the Company\'s approximately . billion in cash andshort-term investments as of December , , the Company has available avariety of future financing sources, including, but not limited to: (i) thereceipt of the remainder of the U.S. Government grant, which approximates million, (ii) additional secured aircraft debt (as of December , , theCompany had approximately . billion net book value of unencumbered aircraft),(iii) the availability of the Company\'s billion credit facility, (iv)sale-leaseback transactions of owned property, including aircraft and realestate, (v) tax-exempt borrowings for airport facilities, (vi) securitization offuture operating receipts, (vii) unsecured borrowings, and (viii) borrowingsbacked by federal loan guarantees as provided under the Act. No assurance can begiven that any of these financing sources will be available on terms acceptableto the Company. However, the Company believes it will meet its financing needsas discussed above. AMR (principally American) historically operates with a working capitaldeficit as do most other airline companies. The existence of such a deficit hasnot in the past impaired the Company\'s ability to meet its obligations as theybecome due and is not expected to do so in the future.OTHER INFORMATIONENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Subsidiaries of AMR have been notified of potentialliability with regard to several environmental cleanup sites and certain airportlocations. At sites where remedial litigation has commenced, potential liabilityis joint and several. AMR\'s alleged volumetric contributions at these sites areminimal compared to others. AMR does not expect these matters, individually orcollectively, to have a material impact on its results of operations, financialposition or liquidity. Additional information is included in Note to theconsolidated financial statements. <PAGE>CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of the Company\'sfinancial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principlesrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amountsreported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. TheCompany believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, actualresults and the timing of the recognition of such amounts could differ fromthose estimates. The Company has identified the following critical accountingpolicies and estimates utilized by management in the preparation of theCompany\'s financial statements: accounting for long-lived assets, passengerrevenue, frequent flyer accounting, and pensions and other postretirementbenefits. Accounting for Long-Lived Assets - The Company has approximately billion of long-lived assets as of December , , including approximately billion related to flight equipment and related fixed assets. In addition to the original cost of these assets, their recorded value is impacted by a number of policy elections made by the Company, including estimated useful lives, salvage values and in , impairment charges. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. , ""Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of"" (SFAS ), the Company records impairment charges on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets. In this circumstance, the impairment charge is determined based upon the amount the net book value of the assets exceeds their fair market value. In making these determinations, the Company utilizes certain assumptions, including, but not limited to: (i) estimated fair market value of the assets, and (ii) estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets, which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization, length of service the asset will be used in the Company\'s operations and estimated salvage values. During , the Company determined its Fokker , Saab and ATR aircraft and related rotables were impaired under SFAS and recorded impairment charges of approximately . billion. In addition, during the fourth quarter of , the Company completed an impairment analysis of its long-lived assets, including aircraft fleets, route acquisition costs, airport operating and gate lease rights, and goodwill. The impairment analysis did not result in any additional impairment charges. See Notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information with respect to each of the policies and assumptions utilized by the Company which affect the recorded values of long-lived assets. Passenger revenue - Passenger ticket sales are initially recorded as a component of air traffic liability. Revenue derived from ticket sales is recognized at the time service is provided. However, due to various factors, including the complex pricing structure and interline agreements throughout the industry, certain amounts are recognized in revenue using estimates regarding both the timing of the revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized. These estimates are generally based upon the evaluation of historical trends, including the use of regression analysis and other methods to model the outcome of future events based on the Company\'s historical experience. Due to the uncertainties surrounding the impact of the September , events on the Company\'s business (see Note to the consolidated financial statements) and the acquisition of TWA in April (see Note to the consolidated financial statements), historical trends may not be representative of future results. Frequent flyer accounting - The Company utilizes a number of estimates in accounting for its AAdvantage frequent flyer program. Additional information regarding the Company\'s AAdvantage frequent flyer program is included in Item - Business (pages and ) and Note to the consolidated financial statements. Changes to the percentage of the amount of revenue deferred, deferred recognition period, cost per mile estimates or the minimum award level accrued could have a significant impact on the Company\'s revenues or incremental cost accrual in the year of the change as well as in future years. In addition, the Emerging Issues Task Force of the Financial Accounting Standards Board is currently reviewing the accounting for both multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements and volume-based sales incentive offers, but has not yet reached a consensus that would apply to programs such as the AAdvantage program. The issuance of new accounting standards could have a significant impact on the Company\'s frequent flyer liability in the year of the change as well as in future years. <PAGE> Pensions and other postretirement benefits - The Company\'s pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are calculated utilizing various actuarial assumptions and methodologies prescribed under Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. , ""Employers\' Accounting for Pensions"" and No. , ""Employers\' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions"". The Company utilizes certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the selection of the: (i) discount rate, (ii) expected return on plan assets, and (iii) expected health care cost trend rate. The discount rate assumption is based upon the review of high quality corporate bond rates and the change in these rates during the year. The expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rate are based upon an evaluation of the Company\'s historical trends and experience taking into account current and expected market conditions. In addition, the Company\'s future pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities will be impacted by the acquisition of TWA and the new labor agreements entered into during . See Note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Company\'s pension and other postretirement benefits.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In July , the Financial Accounting StandardsBoard issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. , ""BusinessCombinations"" (SFAS ) and No. , ""Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets""(SFAS ). SFAS prohibits the use of the pooling-of-interests method forbusiness combinations initiated after June , and includes criteria forthe recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill. SFAS includesthe requirement to test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets forimpairment rather than amortize them. The Company will adopt SFAS in thefirst quarter of , and currently estimates the impact to the Company\'sresults of operations of discontinuing the amortization of goodwill and routeauthorities to be approximately million on an annualized basis. The Companyis currently evaluating what additional impact these new accounting standardsmay have on the Company\'s financial position or results of operations. However,with the decline in the Company\'s market capitalization, in part due to theterrorist attacks on September , , the adoption of SFAS may result inthe impairment of the Company\'s goodwill.OUTLOOK Due in part to the lack of predictability of future traffic, business mixand yields, the Company continues to have difficulty in estimating the impact ofthe events of September , . However, given the magnitude of theseunprecedented events, the Company expects that the adverse impact to the Company- - and to the airline industry as a whole - will continue to be significant in. Because of the high degree of uncertainty, the Company is not currentlyable to provide an estimate for the full year . However, the Company doesexpect to incur a sizable loss in the first quarter, and will likely incur aloss for . Capacity for American - which reflects TWA in the first quarter of but not in the first quarter of - is expected to increase two to threepercent in the first quarter of compared to last year\'s first quarterlevels. American Eagle\'s capacity will be down slightly (see page regardingadditional information on American Eagle\'s capacity). Capacity for the remainderof is less clear and depends on a number of factors, including, but notlimited to, how quickly demand returns and what levels of capacity the Company\'scompetitors deploy. Traffic continues to remain challenging to predict. However,for the first quarter of , the Company expects traffic to be up about threepercent from last year\'s first quarter levels. In response to the September terrorist attacks, the Company put in place numerous cost reduction initiatives,including, but not limited to: cutting capacity, grounding aircraft anddeferring certain aircraft deliveries to future years, sharply reducing capitalspending, closing facilities, trimming food service and reducing its workforce.In addition, the Company expects to see lower fuel prices in the first quarterof compared to . Somewhat offsetting these cost savings, however, willbe higher wages, salaries and benefit costs, higher security costs and insurancepremiums, and greater interest expense. American\'s unit costs for the firstquarter of are expected to be three to five percent higher than last year\'sfirst quarter. <PAGE>FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION The preceding discussions under Business, Properties, Legal Proceedingsand Management\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations contain various forward-looking statements within the meaning ofSection A of the Securities Act of , as amended, and Section E of theSecurities Exchange Act of , as amended, which represent the Company\'sexpectations or beliefs concerning future events. When used in this document andin documents incorporated herein by reference, the words ""expects,"" ""plans,""""anticipates,"" ""believes,"" and similar expressions are intended to identifyforward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, withoutlimitation, the Company\'s expectations concerning operations and financialconditions, including changes in capacity, revenues and costs, expectations asto future financing needs, overall economic conditions and plans and objectivesfor future operations, the ability to continue to successfully integrate withits operations the assets acquired from TWA and the former TWA workforce, andthe impact of the events of September , on the Company and thesufficiency of the Company\'s financial resources to absorb that impact. Otherforward-looking statements include statements which do not relate solely tohistorical facts, such as, without limitation, statements which discuss thepossible future effects of current known trends or uncertainties, or whichindicate that the future effects of known trends or uncertainties cannot bepredicted, guaranteed or assured. All forward-looking statements in this reportare based upon information available to the Company on the date of this report.The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise anyforward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future eventsor otherwise. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of factors thatcould cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Thefollowing factors, in addition to other possible factors not listed, could causethe Company\'s actual results to differ materially from those expressed inforward-looking statements:UNCERTAINTY OF FUTURE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS AND EVENTS The Company\'soperations could be adversely affected by failure of the Company to reachagreement with any labor union representing the Company\'s employees (including,for example, the successful integration of TWA\'s workforce) or by an agreementwith any such labor union representing the Company\'s employees that containsterms which prevent the Company from competing effectively with other airlines.In addition, a dispute between the Company and an employee work group (outsidethe confines of a collective bargaining agreement) could adversely impact theCompany\'s operations.ECONOMIC AND OTHER CONDITIONS The airline industry is affected by changes ininternational, national, regional and local economic conditions, inflation, waror political instability (or the threat thereof), consumer preferences andspending patterns, demographic trends, disruptions to the air traffic controlsystem, consumer perceptions of airline safety, costs of safety, security andenvironmental measures, and the weather.FUEL PRICES SUPPLY Due to the competitive nature of the airline industry,there can be no assurance that the Company would be able to pass on anyincreased fuel prices to its customers by increasing fares. Moreover, to theextent there was a reduction in the supply of jet fuel, the Company\'s operationscould be adversely impacted.COMPETITION IN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY Service over almost all of the Company\'sroutes is highly competitive. The Company faces vigorous competition from majordomestic airlines, national, regional, all-cargo and charter carriers, foreignair carriers, low-cost air carriers, and, particularly on shorter segments,ground transportation. Increasingly the Company faces significant competitionfrom marketingoperational alliances formed by its competitors. To the extentthose alliances can undertake activities that are not available to the Company,the Company\'s ability to effectively compete could be hindered. Pricingdecisions are affected by competition from other airlines. Fare discounting bycompetitors has historically had a negative effect on the Company\'s financialresults because the Company is generally required to match competitors\' fares tomaintain passenger traffic. No assurance can be given that any future farereduction would be offset by increases in passenger traffic, a reduction incosts or changes in the mix of traffic that would improve yields.CHANGING BUSINESS STRATEGY Although it has no current plan to do so, the Companymay change its business strategy in the future and may not pursue some of thegoals stated herein. <PAGE>GOVERNMENT REGULATION Future results of the Company\'s operations may vary basedupon any actions which the governmental agencies with jurisdiction over theCompany\'s operations may take, including the granting and timing of certaingovernmental approvals (including foreign government approvals) needed forcode-sharing alliances and other arrangements with other airlines, restrictionson competitive practices (e.g., Court Orders, or Agency regulations or orders,that would curtail an airline\'s ability to respond to a competitor), theadoption of regulations that impact customer service standards (e.g., newpassenger security standards), and the adoption of more restrictivelocally-imposed noise restrictions.UNCERTAINTY IN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS The Company\'s current internationalactivities and prospects could be adversely affected by factors such asreversals or delays in the opening of foreign markets, exchange controls,currency and political risks, taxation and changes in international governmentregulation of the Company\'s operations.ADVERSE IMPACT OF THE TERRORIST ATTACKS As described elsewhere in this Report,the events of September , had and continue to have a material adverseimpact on the Company. Among the effects experienced by the Company from theSeptember , terrorist attacks have been significant flight disruptioncosts caused by the FAA\'s imposed grounding of the U.S. airline industry\'sfleet, significantly increased security and other costs, a reduction in theavailability of insurance coverage by insurance carriers, significantly higherticket refunds, significantly reduced load factors, and significantly reducedyields. The occurrence of another terrorist attack (whether domestic orinternational and whether against the Company or another entity) could againhave a material adverse impact on the Company, its finances andor itsoperations by further aggravating the aforementioned effects.AVAILABILITY OF FUTURE FINANCING In the aftermath of the events of September ,, the Company raised substantial amounts of money to finance capitalcommitments and day-to-day operations. Although the Company has a substantialamount of unencumbered assets, there is no guarantee that it will be able to usethose assets for financing activities or that these assets will maintain theircurrent market value. To the extent that the Company may be unable to access thecapital markets for long-term capital spending requirements or short-termliquidity needs, the Company\'s finances andor operations could be adverselyimpacted. As noted elsewhere in this Report, in the aftermath of the events ofSeptember , , credit ratings for the Company\'s debt instruments weredowngraded. To the extent the Company\'s credit ratings are further downgraded,it could have an adverse impact on the ability of the Company to access capitalmarkets andor the costs of such financing.AVAILABILITY OF THE ACT As reported elsewhere in this Report, the Act hasmitigated some of the material adverse consequences of the events of September, . To the extent there are amendments to, or interpretations of, the Actor successful challenges to the Act, any of which are contrary to suchmitigation, the Company\'s finances andor operations could be adverselyimpacted. <PAGE>ITEM ']",,

AMR\'s operating loss of million increased million compared to the same period in . The Company\'s results continue to be adversely impacted by the September , terrorist attacks. In addition, on April , , American Airlines,Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of AMR) purchased substantially all ofthe assets and assumed certain liabilities of Trans World Airlines,Inc. (TWA). Accordingly, the operating results of TWA are included inthe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for thethree-month period ended March , but not for the three-monthperiod ended March , . All references to American Airlines,Inc. include TWA (collectively, American).Although traffic has continued to increase on significantly reducedcapacity since the events of September , , the Company\'s firstquarter revenues were down significantly year-over-year. Inaddition to the residual effects of September , the Company\'srevenues continue to be negatively impacted by the economic slowdown- -- seen largely in business travel declines -- and an increase in faresale activity.

This change allows the Company to carryback and NOLs for five years, rather than two years underthe existing law, allowing the Company to more quickly recover itsNOLs. The extended NOL carryback did, however, result in thedisplacement of foreign tax credits taken in prior years.

No assurance can be given that any of these financing sourceswill be available on terms acceptable to the Company. However, theCompany believes it will meet its current financing needs. --<Page> As a result of the September , events, aviation insurers havesignificantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverageavailable to commercial air carriers for liability to persons otherthan employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts ofterrorism, war or similar events (war-risk coverage). At the sametime, they significantly increased the premiums for such coverage aswell as for aviation insurance in general. Pursuant to authoritygranted in the Act, the Government has supplemented the commercial war-risk insurance until May , with a third party liability policyto cover losses to persons other than employees or passengers forrenewable -day periods. In the event the insurance carriers reducefurther the amount of insurance coverage available or the Governmentfails to renew war-risk insurance, the Company\'s operations andorfinancial position, results of operations or cash flows would beadversely impacted.As discussed in the Company\'s Form -K, a provision in thecurrent Allied Pilots Association contract further limits the numberof ASMs and block hours flown by American\'s regional carrier partnerswhen American pilots are on furlough. As AMR Eagle continues toaccept previously ordered regional jets, this will cause the ASM capto be reached sometime in the first half of , necessitatingactions to comply with that cap. American is working with itsregional partners to ensure that it is in compliance with thisprovision. Actions currently being taken and considered by AMR Eagleto reduce its capacity are discussed in the Company\'s Form -K.In addition, American is removing its code from flights of theAmerican Connection carriers, which are independent carriers thatprovide feed to American\'s St. Louis hub. American believes that thecombination of all these actions will enable it to comply with the ASMcap through and for sometime beyond.OUTLOOKCapacity for American is expected to be down approximately percentin the second quarter of compared to last year\'s second quarterlevels. AMR Eagle\'s second quarter capacity will be down about threepercent from last year\'s levels. For the second quarter of , theCompany expects traffic to be lower by approximately percent ascompared to last year\'s second quarter levels. Pressure to reducecosts will continue, although the Company will continue to see higherwages, salaries and benefit costs, higher security costs and insurancepremiums, and greater interest expense. Although the Company expectsto see an increase in fuel prices as compared to the first quarter of, fuel prices are expected to remain lower in the second quarterof as compared to last year\'s second quarter prices. Further,the Company expects to see a benefit in commission expense due to thedomestic base commission changes implemented in March . In totalhowever, American\'s unit costs for the second quarter of areexpected to be two to three percent higher than last year\'s secondquarter. Given this higher unit cost, coupled with the revenuepressures seen in the first quarter and expected to continue into thesecond quarter, the Company expects to incur a loss in the secondquarter (although the Company does not expect this loss to be of thesame magnitude as the Company\'s first quarter loss), and will likelyincur a loss for .FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATIONStatements in this report contain various forward-looking statementswithin the meaning of Section A of the Securities Act of , asamended, and Section E of the Securities Exchange Act of , asamended, which represent the Company\'s expectations or beliefsconcerning future events.

Accordingly, the operatingresults of TWA LLC are included in the accompanying condensedconsolidated financial statements for the six month period ended June, whereas for the results of TWA LLC were included onlyfor the period April , through June , . In addition, AMR\'s results include: (i) a million charge ( million after-tax,or . per share) related to the writedown of the carrying valueof its Fokker , Saab and ATR- aircraft and related rotables,and (ii) a million gain ( million after-tax, or . pershare) from the settlement of a legal matter related to theCompany\'s labor disruption.Although traffic has continued to increase on significantly reducedcapacity since the events of September , , the Company\'s revenues were down significantly year-over-year. In addition to theresidual effects of September , the Company\'s revenues continue tobe negatively impacted by the economic slowdown, seen largely inbusiness travel declines, the geographic distribution of the Company\'snetwork and reduced fares. In total, the Company\'s revenues decreased, million, or . percent, in versus the same period in.

AMR Eagle\'s traffic increased . percent while capacitydecreased . percent, to approximately . billion ASMs. As withAmerican, the decrease in AMR Eagle\'s revenues was due primarily tothe continued impact of the September , terrorist attacks andthe economic slowdown.Cargo revenues decreased million, or . percent, primarily dueto the same reasons as noted above.Other revenues decreased . percent, or million, due primarilyto decreases in contract maintenance work that American performs forother airlines, and decreases in codeshare revenue and employee travelservice charges. <Page> RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)The Company\'s operating expenses decreased . percent, orapproximately , million. American\'s cost per ASM increased by. percent to . cents, excluding the impact of the second quarter asset impairment charge. Wages, salaries and benefits increased. percent, or million, reflecting (i) a decrease in the averagenumber of equivalent employees, somewhat offset by higher averagesalaries, and (ii) increases in the Company\'s pension and health insurancecosts, the latter reflecting rapidly rising medical care andprescription drug costs.

Aircraft rentals increased million,or . percent, due primarily the addition of TWA aircraft. Food servicedecreased . percent, or million, due primarily to the Company\'sreduced operating schedule and change in level of food service.Commissions to agents decreased . percent, or million, due primarilyto a . percent decrease in passenger revenues and commission structurechanges implemented in March . Special charges of million relatedto the writedown of the carrying value of the Company\'s Fokker ,Saab and ATR- aircraft and related rotables during the secondquarter of . Other operating expenses decreased . percent, or million, due primarily to decreases in contractmaintenance work that American performs for other airlines, anddecreases in travel and incidental costs, credit card and bookingfees, advertising and promotion costs, and data processing expenses,which were partially offset by higher insurance and security costs.Other income (expense) increased million due to the following:Interest income decreased . percent, or million, due primarilyto decreases in interest rates. Interest expense increased million, or . percent, resulting primarily from the increase in theCompany\'s long-term debt. Interest capitalized decreased million,or . percent, due primarily to a decrease in purchase deposits forflight equipment. Miscellaneous-net decreased million dueprimarily to a million gain recorded during the second quarter of from the settlement of a legal matter related to the Company\'s labor disruption and the write-down of certain investments heldby the Company during the first quarter of .The effective tax rate for the six months ended June , wasimpacted by a million charge resulting from a provision inCongress\' economic stimulus package that changes the period forcarrybacks of NOLs. This change allows the Company to carry back and NOLs for five years, rather than two years under the existinglaw, allowing the Company to more quickly recover its NOLs. The extendedNOL carryback did however, result in the displacement of foreign taxcredits taken in prior years.

These capital expenditures were financed primarily throughsecured mortgage and debt agreements. Proceeds from the sale ofequipment and property of million include the proceeds receivedupon delivery of three McDonnell Douglas MD- aircraft to FedEx.As of June , , the Company had commitments to acquire thefollowing aircraft: Boeing -s, Boeing -ERs, nineBoeing -ERs, Embraer regional jets and Bombardier CRJ-s. Deliveries of these aircraft are scheduled to continue through. Payments for these aircraft are expected to be approximately million during the remainder of , . billion in , .billion in and an aggregate of approximately . billion in through .In June , Standard & Poor\'s downgraded the credit ratings of AMRand American, and the credit ratings of a number of other majorairlines. The long-term credit ratings of AMR and American wereremoved from Standand & Poor\'s Credit Watch with negative implicationsand were given a negative outlook. Any additional reductions in AMR\'sor American\'s credit ratings could result in increased borrowing coststo the Company and might limit the availability of future financingneeds. <Page> In addition to the Company\'s approximately . billion in cash andshort-term investments as of June , , the Company has availablea variety of future financing sources, including, but not limited to:(i) the receipt of the remainder of the U.S. Government grantauthorized by the Air Transportation Safety and System StabilizationAct (the Act), which is estimated to be in excess of million, (ii)additional secured aircraft debt, (iii) the availability of theCompany\'s billion credit facility, (iv) sale-leaseback transactionsof owned property, including aircraft and real estate, (v) therecovery of past federal income taxes paid as a result of a provisionin the recently passed economic stimulus package regarding NOLcarrybacks, (vi) tax-exempt borrowings for airport facilities, (vii)securitization of future operating receipts, and (viii) unsecuredborrowings. No assurance can be given that any of these financingsources will be available on terms acceptable to the Company.However, the Company believes it will meet its current financingneeds.Pursuant to the Act, the Government made available to air carriers,subject to certain conditions, up to billion in federal governmentguarantees of certain loans. American did not seek such loanguarantees.OTHER INFORMATIONAs a result of the September , events, aviation insurers havesignificantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverageavailable to commercial air carriers for liability to persons otherthan employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts ofterrorism, war or similar events (war-risk coverage). At the sametime, they significantly increased the premiums for such coverage aswell as for aviation insurance in general. Pursuant to authoritygranted in the Act, the Government has supplemented the commercial war-risk insurance until August , with a third party liabilitypolicy to cover losses to persons other than employees or passengersfor renewable -day periods. In the event the insurance carriersreduce further the amount of insurance coverage available or theGovernment fails to renew war-risk insurance, the Company\'s operationsandor financial position, results of operations or cash flows wouldbe adversely impacted.As discussed in the Company\'s Form -K, a provision in thecurrent Allied Pilots Association (APA) contract freezes the number ofASMs and block hours flown on American\'s two letter marketing code byAmerican\'s regional carrier partners when American pilots are onfurlough (the ASM cap). As AMR Eagle continues to accept previouslyordered regional jets, this ASM cap would be reached sometime in ,necessitating actions to insure compliance with the ASM cap. Americanis working with its regional partners to accomplish this. Actionscurrently being taken and considered by AMR Eagle to reduce itscapacity are discussed in the Company\'s Form -K. In addition,American is removing its code from flights of the AmericanConnectioncarriers, which are independent carriers that provide feed toAmerican\'s St. Louis hub. American believes that the combination ofthese actions will enable it to comply with this ASM cap through and for sometime beyond.In addition, another provision in the current APA contract limits thetotal number of regional jets with more than seats flown under theAmerican code by American\'s regional carrier partners to aircraft.Similar to the above, as AMR Eagle continues to accept previouslyordered Bombardier CRJ aircraft, this cap would be reached in early. In order to ensure American remains in compliance with thisprovision, AMR Eagle has reached an agreement in principle to disposeof Embraer aircraft. Ultimately, these airplanes will beacquired by Trans States Airlines, an AmericanConnection carrier.Trans States Airlines will operate these aircraft under its two letterairline code and expects to deploy these aircraft at its St. Louis hubwhere it feeds American. The potential transaction still requires theconsent of certain third parties, including the companies financing theseaircraft, and is subject to the negotiation of final documentation.Effective January , , the Company adopted Statementof Financial Accounting Standards No. , ""Goodwill and OtherIntangible Assets"" (SFAS ). SFAS requires the Company to testgoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (for AMR, routeacquisition costs) for impairment rather than amortize them. Duringthe first quarter of , the Company completed its impairmentanalysis for route acquisition costs in accordance with SFAS . Theanalysis did not result in an impairment charge. During the secondquarter of , the Company completed the first step of itsimpairment analysis related to its . billion of goodwill anddetermined the Company\'s net book value to be in excess of theCompany\'s fair market value at January , , using AMR as thereporting unit for purposes of the fair value determination. As aresult, the Company is in the process of completing the second step ofthe impairment analysis which will allocate the newly determined fairvalue of AMR to each of its assets and liabilities. This allocationis expected to be completed during the third or fourth quarter of and will likely result in the Company recording a one-time, non-cashpre-tax charge of up to . billion to write-down AMR\'s goodwill.Such charge would be nonoperational in nature and would be reflectedas a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the consolidatedstatements of operations. <Page> OUTLOOKCapacity for American is expected to be down approximately two percentin the third quarter of compared to last year\'s third quarterlevels. AMR Eagle\'s third quarter capacity will be down about onepercent from last year\'s levels. For the third quarter of , theCompany expects traffic to be about flat as compared to last year\'sthird quarter levels. Pressure to reduce costs will continue,although the Company will continue to see higher benefit and securitycosts, increased insurance premiums, and greater interest expense.However, the Company expects to see a slight decrease in fuel pricesas compared to the third quarter of and the continued decline incommission expense due to the commission changes implemented earlierin . In total, American\'s unit costs, excluding special charges,for the third quarter of are expected to be down approximately. percent from last year\'s third quarter level. Notwithstanding theexpected decrease in unit costs however, given the revenue pressuresseen in the first half of the year and expected to continue into thethird quarter, the Company expects to incur a sizable loss in thethird quarter and a significant loss for .In response to these financial challenges, the Company has undertakena comprehensive review of its business to better align its coststructure with the current revenue environment, aimed at improvingproductivity, simplifying operations and reducing costs. The Companyhas begun to implement certain of these changes, including a fleetsimplification program, adjustments to its operating schedule andincreased airport automation, and will continue to refine its businessthroughout the coming months.FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATIONStatements in this report contain various forward-looking statementswithin the meaning of Section A of the Securities Act of , asamended, and Section E of the Securities Exchange Act of , asamended, which represent the Company\'s expectations or beliefsconcerning future events.

Effective rates on these agreements are fixed or variablebased on LIBOR plus a spread and mature over various periods of timethrough . At September , , the effective interest rates onthese debt agreements and the enhanced equipment trust certificatesdescribed above ranged up to . percent.During March , the Regional Airports Improvement Corporationissued facilities sublease revenue bonds at the Los AngelesInternational Airport to provide reimbursement to American for certainfacility construction costs. The Company has recorded the totalamount of the issuance of million (net of million discount)as long-term debt on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as ofSeptember , .

American did not seek such loanguarantees.OTHER INFORMATIONAs a result of the September , events, aviation insurers havesignificantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverageavailable to commercial air carriers for liability to persons otherthan employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts ofterrorism, war or similar events (war-risk coverage). At the sametime, they significantly increased the premiums for such coverage aswell as for aviation insurance in general. Pursuant to authoritygranted in the Act, the Government has supplemented the commercial war-risk insurance until December , with a third party liabilitypolicy to cover losses to persons other than employees or passengers.In the event the commercial insurance carriers reduce further theamount of insurance coverage available to the Company or furthersignificantly increase the cost of aviation insurance, or if theGovernment fails to renew the war-risk insurance that it provides, theCompany\'s operations andor financial position and results ofoperations would be materially adversely affected. --<Page> OTHER INFORMATION (Continued)As discussed in the Company\'s Form -K, a provision in thecurrent Allied Pilots Association (APA) contract freezes the number ofASMs and block hours flown under American\'s two letter marketing code(AA) by American\'s regional carrier partners when American pilots areon furlough (the ASM cap). As AMR Eagle continues to acceptpreviously ordered regional jets, this ASM cap was reached in ,necessitating actions to insure compliance with the ASM cap. Theseactions as well as additional potential actions in respect to the ASMcap are discussed in the Company\'s Form -K. In addition,American has removed its code from some flights of theAmericanConnection carriers, which are independent carriers thatprovide feed to American\'s St. Louis hub, and will continue to removeits codes from additional flights of the carriers as warranted.American believes that the combination of these actions will enableit to continue to comply with this ASM cap through and forsometime beyond.In addition, another provision in the current APA contract limits thetotal number of regional jets with more than seats flown under theAmerican code by American\'s regional carrier partners to aircraft.Similar to the above, as AMR Eagle continues to accept previouslyordered Bombardier CRJ aircraft, this cap would be reached in early. In order to ensure American remains in compliance with thisprovision, AMR Eagle has reached an agreement in principle to disposeof Embraer aircraft. Ultimately, these airplanes will beacquired by Trans States Airlines, an AmericanConnection carrier.Trans States Airlines will operate these aircraft under its two letterairline code (AX) and expects to deploy these aircraft at its St.Louis hub where it feeds American. The potential transaction stillrequires the consent of certain third parties, including the companiesfinancing these aircraft, and is subject to the negotiation of finaldocumentation.The Company believes that if actual investment returns continue atcurrent levels and interest rates remain unchanged through the rest ofthe year, it will be required to record a significant minimum pensionliability as of December , . The minimum pension liability wouldreflect the amount that the pension plans\' accumulated benefitobligation exceeds the plans\' assets in excess of amounts previouslyaccrued for pension costs. A large portion of the charge would berecorded as a reduction to stockholders\' equity, as a component ofaccumulated comprehensive loss, net of any available tax benefit.Although the exact amount of the charge to stockholders\' equity is notknown at this time, it will likely exceed billion (before tax). Asof December , , the Company\'s minimum pension liability reducedstockholders\' equity by approximately million (before tax). Thischarge to stockholders\' equity will not affect the Company\'s financialcovenants in any of its credit agreements.Furthermore, given the Company\'s current financial situation, adeferred tax asset valuation allowance may be necessary. Indetermining whether a deferred tax asset valuation allowance isnecessary, the Company considers whether it is more likely than notthat some portion or all of the Company\'s deferred tax assets will notbe realized. Although a valuation allowance is not necessary as ofSeptember , , due to the existence of available deferred taxliabilities, it is likely that beginning late in the fourth quarter of or early in the first quarter of a valuation allowance willbe necessary. In effect the Company would not be able to recognize atax benefit of losses incurred, resulting in larger reported netlosses. --<Page> FOURTH QUARTER OUTLOOKCapacity for American is expected to be up approximately six percentin the fourth quarter of compared to last year\'s fourth quarterlevels, and down percent from the fourth quarter of .AMR Eagle\'s fourth quarter capacity will be up about ten percent fromlast year\'s levels, and down one percent from the fourth quarter of. For the fourth quarter of , the Company expects traffic tobe up approximately thirteen percent from last year\'s fourth quarterlevels, and down percent from the fourth quarter of . Pressureto reduce costs will continue, although the Company will continue tosee higher benefit and security costs, increased insurance premiums,and greater interest expense. In addition, the Company expects to seea percent increase in fuel prices as compared to the fourth quarterof and a continued decline in commission expense due to thecommission changes implemented earlier in . In total, American\'sunit costs, excluding special charges, for the fourth quarter of are expected to be down approximately three percent from last year\'sfourth quarter level. Notwithstanding the expected decrease in unitcosts however, given the revenue pressures expected to continue intothe fourth quarter and the current level of fuel prices, the Companyexpects to incur a significant loss in the fourth quarter, likely inexcess of the third quarter loss excluding special charges.In response to these financial challenges, the Company is continuingits comprehensive review of its business to better align its coststructure with the current revenue environment, aimed at improvingproductivity, simplifying operations and reducing costs.In addition, on August , , the Company announced a series ofshort- and long- term initiatives to reduce its costs, reducecapacity, simplify its aircraft fleet, and enhance productivity.These initiatives include, among other things, de-peaking of theCompany\'s DallasFort Worth International Airport hub (following thede-peaking of its Chicago hub in April ) by scheduling flightsinto and out of the hub more continuously, with flights spread outmore evenly through the day; gradually phasing out operation of itsFokker aircraft fleet by ; and reducing capacity in the fourthquarter of . By de-peaking its DallasFort Worth and Chicago hubsthe Company believes it can more productively use its employees,gates, and aircraft. In addition, the Company announced that it wouldreduce an estimated , jobs by March to realign its workforcewith the planned capacity reductions, fleet simplification, and hubrestructurings. American subsequently announced that it expects fullyear capacity for to be down about three percent from ,giving effect to the capacity reduction described above. AlthoughAmerican expects these initiatives to improve efficiency and reduceoperating costs, there can be no assurance that these initiatives willbe successful or sufficient.OTHER RISK FACTORSAs a result of weak domestic and international economic conditions,reduced fares, and the terrorist attacks of September , , theairline industry as a whole suffered substantial losses in , andis expected to suffer significant losses for . Many airlines, inaddition to American, have announced reductions in capacity, serviceand workforce in response to the industry-wide reductions in passengerdemand and yields. In addition, since September , several aircarriers have sought to reorganize under Chapter of the UnitedStates Bankruptcy Code, including US Airways, Inc. (US Airways), theseventh largest domestic air carrier. More recently, United AirLines, Inc. (United), the second largest domestic air carrier, haspublicly stated that, if it is not able to realize substantial costsavings from its current cost savings initiatives, it may be forced toreorganize under the Bankruptcy Code. Successful completion of suchreorganizations could present American with competitors withsignificantly lower operating costs derived from labor, supply, andfinancing contracts renegotiated under the protection of theBankruptcy Code. In addition, historically, air carriers involved inreorganizations have undertaken substantial fare discounting in orderto maintain cash flows and to enhance continued customer loyalty.Such fare discounting could further lower yields for all carriers,including American. Further, the market value of aircraft wouldlikely be negatively impacted if a number of air carriers, includingUS Airways and United, seek to reduce capacity by eliminating aircraftfrom their fleets.Moreover, the increased threat of U.S. military involvement inoverseas operations (including, for example, the hostilities inAfghanistan and the threat of war with Iraq) could have a materialadverse impact on the Company\'s business, financial position(including access to capital markets) and results of operations and onthe airline industry in general. --<Page> FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATIONStatements in this report contain various forward-looking statementswithin the meaning of Section A of the Securities Act of , asamended, and Section E of the Securities Exchange Act of , asamended, which represent the Company\'s expectations or beliefsconcerning future events.

However, the Company believes it will meetits current financing needs. --<PAGE>As a result of the September , events, aviation insurers havesignificantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available tocommercial air carriers for liability to persons other than employees orpassengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events(war-risk coverage). At the same time, they significantly increased the premiumsfor such coverage as well as for aviation insurance in general. Pursuant toauthority granted in the Act, the Government has supplemented the commercialwar-risk insurance until May , with a third party liability policy tocover losses to persons other than employees or passengers for renewable -dayperiods. In the event the insurance carriers reduce further the amount ofinsurance coverage available or the Government fails to renew war-riskinsurance, the Company\'s operations andor financial position, results ofoperations or cash flows would be adversely impacted.As discussed in the Company\'s Form -K, a provision in the current AlliedPilots Association contract further limits the number of ASMs and block hoursflown by American\'s regional carrier partners when American pilots are onfurlough. As AMR Eagle continues to accept previously ordered regional jets,this will cause the ASM cap to be reached sometime in the first half of ,necessitating actions to comply with that cap. American is working with itsregional partners to ensure that it is in compliance with this provision.Actions currently being taken and considered by AMR Eagle to reduce its capacityare discussed in the Company\'s Form -K. In addition, American is removingits code from flights of the American Connection carriers, which are independentcarriers that provide feed to American\'s St. Louis hub. American believes thatthe combination of all these actions will enable it to comply with the ASM capthrough and for sometime beyond.OUTLOOKCapacity for American is expected to be down approximately percent in thesecond quarter of compared to last year\'s second quarter levels. AMREagle\'s second quarter capacity will be down about three percent from lastyear\'s levels. For the second quarter of , the Company expects traffic to belower by approximately percent as compared to last year\'s second quarterlevels. Pressure to reduce costs will continue, although the Company willcontinue to see higher wages, salaries and benefit costs, higher security costsand insurance premiums, and greater interest expense. Although the Companyexpects to see an increase in fuel prices as compared to the first quarter of, fuel prices are expected to remain lower in the second quarter of ascompared to last year\'s second quarter prices. Further, the Company expects tosee a benefit in commission expense due to the domestic base commission changesimplemented in March . In total however, American\'s unit costs for thesecond quarter of are expected to be two to three percent higher than lastyear\'s second quarter. Given this higher unit cost, coupled with the revenuepressures seen in the first quarter and expected to continue into the secondquarter, the Company expects to incur a loss in the second quarter (although theCompany does not expect this loss to be of the same magnitude as the Company\'sfirst quarter loss), and will likely incur a loss for .FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATIONStatements in this report contain various forward-looking statements within themeaning of Section A of the Securities Act of , as amended, and SectionE of the Securities Exchange Act of , as amended, which represent theCompany\'s expectations or beliefs concerning future events.

Thedecrease in international capacity was driven by a . percent, . percentand . percent reduction in Pacific, European and Latin American ASMs,respectively.AMR Eagle\'s PASSENGER REVENUES decreased . percent, or million. AMREagle\'s traffic increased . percent while capacity decreased . percent, toapproximately . billion ASMs. As with American, the decrease in AMR Eagle\'srevenues was due primarily to the continued impact of the September , terrorist attacks and the economic slowdown.Cargo REVENUES decreased million, or . percent, primarily due to the samereasons as noted above.OTHER REVENUES decreased . percent, or million, due primarily todecreases in contract maintenance work that American performs for otherairlines, and decreases in codeshare revenue and employee travel servicecharges. --<PAGE>RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)The Company\'s OPERATING EXPENSES decreased . percent, or approximately ,million. American\'s COST PER ASM increased by . percent to . cents,excluding the impact of the second quarter asset impairment charge. WAGES,SALARIES AND BENEFITS increased . percent, or million, reflecting (i) adecrease in the average number of equivalent employees, somewhat offset byhigher salaries, and (ii) increases in the Company\'s pension and healthinsurance costs, the latter reflecting rapidly rising medical care andprescription drug costs. AIRCRAFT FUEL expense decreased . percent, or million, due primarily to a . percent decrease in the Company\'s average priceper gallon of fuel and a . percent decrease in the Company\'s fuel consumption.AIRCRAFT RENTALS increased million, or . percent, due primarily theaddition of TWA aircraft. FOOD SERVICE decreased . percent, or million,due primarily to the Company\'s reduced operating schedule and change in level offood service. COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS decreased . percent, or million, dueprimarily to a . percent decrease in passenger revenues and commissionstructure changes implemented in March . SPECIAL CHARGES of millionrelated to the writedown of the carrying value of the Company\'s Fokker , Saab and ATR- aircraft and related rotables during the second quarter of .OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES decreased . percent, or million, due primarilyto decreases in contract maintenance work that American performs for otherairlines, and decreases in travel and incidental costs, credit card and bookingfees, advertising and promotion costs, and data processing expenses, which werepartially offset by higher insurance and security costs.OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) increased million due to the following: INTERESTINCOME decreased . percent, or million, due primarily to decreases ininterest rates. INTEREST EXPENSE increased million, or . percent,resulting primarily from the increase in the Company\'s long-term debt. INTERESTCAPITALIZED decreased million, or . percent, due primarily to a decreasein purchase deposits for flight equipment. MISCELLANEOUS-NET decreased million due primarily to a million gain recorded during the second quarterof from the settlement of a legal matter related to the Company\'s labor disruption and the write-down of certain investments held by the Companyduring the first quarter of .The effective tax rate for the six months ended June , was impacted by a million charge resulting from a provision in Congress\' economic stimuluspackage that changes the period for carrybacks of NOLs. This change allows theCompany to carry back and NOLs for five years, rather than two yearsunder the existing law, allowing the Company to more quickly recover its NOLs.The extended NOL carryback did however, result in the displacement of foreigntax credits taken in prior years. These credits are now expected to expirebefore being utilized by the Company, resulting in this charge. --<PAGE>RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)<Table><Caption>OPERATING STATISTICS Six Months Ended June , ------------------------- ------ ------<S> <C> <C>AMERICAN AIRLINES Revenue passenger miles (millions) , , Available seat miles (millions) , , Cargo ton miles (millions) , Passenger load factor . .

Included in net cashprovided by operating activities during the first six months of wasapproximately million received by the Company as a result of theutilization of its NOL\'s. Capital expenditures for the first six months of were , million, and included the acquisition of seven Boeing -s,three Boeing -ERs, Embraer s and four Bombardier CRJ- aircraft.These capital expenditures were financed primarily through secured mortgage anddebt agreements. Proceeds from the sale of equipment and property of million include the proceeds received upon delivery of three McDonnell DouglasMD- aircraft to FedEx.As of June , , the Company had commitments to acquire the followingaircraft: Boeing -s, Boeing -ERs, nine Boeing -ERs, Embraer regional jets and Bombardier CRJ-s. Deliveries of these aircraftare scheduled to continue through . Payments for these aircraft are expectedto be approximately million during the remainder of , . billion in, . billion in and an aggregate of approximately . billion in through .In June , Standard & Poor\'s downgraded the credit ratings of AMR andAmerican, and the credit ratings of a number of other major airlines. Thelong-term credit ratings of AMR and American were removed from Standard & Poor\'sCredit Watch with negative implications and were given a negative outlook. Anyadditional reductions in AMR\'s or American\'s credit ratings could result inincreased borrowing costs to the Company and might limit the availability offuture financing needs. --<PAGE>In addition to the Company\'s approximately . billion in cash and short-terminvestments as of June , , the Company has available a variety of futurefinancing sources, including, but not limited to: (i) the receipt of theremainder of the U.S. Government grant authorized by the Air TransportationSafety and System Stabilization Act (the Act), which is estimated to be inexcess of million, (ii) additional secured aircraft debt, (iii) theavailability of the Company\'s billion credit facility, (iv) sale-leasebacktransactions of owned property, including aircraft and real estate, (v) therecovery of past federal income taxes paid as a result of a provision in therecently passed economic stimulus package regarding NOL carrybacks, (vi)tax-exempt borrowings for airport facilities, (vii) securitization of futureoperating receipts, and (viii) unsecured borrowings. No assurance can be giventhat any of these financing sources will be available on terms acceptable to theCompany. However, the Company believes it will meet its current financing needs.Pursuant to the Act, the Government made available to air carriers, subject tocertain conditions, up to billion in federal government guarantees ofcertain loans. American did not seek such loan guarantees.OTHER INFORMATIONAs a result of the September , events, aviation insurers havesignificantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available tocommercial air carriers for liability to persons other than employees orpassengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events(war-risk coverage). At the same time, they significantly increased the premiumsfor such coverage as well as for aviation insurance in general. Pursuant toauthority granted in the Act, the Government has supplemented the commercialwar-risk insurance until August , with a third party liability policy tocover losses to persons other than employees or passengers for renewable -dayperiods. In the event the insurance carriers reduce further the amount ofinsurance coverage available or the Government fails to renew war-riskinsurance, the Company\'s operations andor financial position, results ofoperations or cash flows would be adversely impacted.As discussed in the Company\'s Form -K, a provision in the current AlliedPilots Association (APA) contract freezes the number of ASMs and block hoursflown on American\'s two letter marketing code by American\'s regional carrierpartners when American pilots are on furlough (the ASM cap). As AMR Eaglecontinues to accept previously ordered regional jets, this ASM cap would bereached sometime in , necessitating actions to insure compliance with theASM cap. American is working with its regional partners to accomplish this.Actions currently being taken and considered by AMR Eagle to reduce its capacityare discussed in the Company\'s Form -K. In addition, American is removingits code from flights of the AmericanConnection carriers, which are independentcarriers that provide feed to American\'s St. Louis hub. American believes thatthe combination of these actions will enable it to comply with this ASM capthrough and for sometime beyond.In addition, another provision in the current APA contract limits the totalnumber of regional jets with more than seats flown under the American code byAmerican\'s regional carrier partners to aircraft. Similar to the above, asAMR Eagle continues to accept previously ordered Bombardier CRJ aircraft, thiscap would be reached in early . In order to ensure American remains incompliance with this provision, AMR Eagle has reached an agreement in principleto dispose of Embraer aircraft. Ultimately, these airplanes will beacquired by Trans States Airlines, an AmericanConnection carrier. Trans StatesAirlines will operate these aircraft under its two letter airline code andexpects to deploy these aircraft at its St. Louis hub where it feeds American.The potential transaction still requires the consent of certain third parties,including the companies financing these aircraft, and is subject to thenegotiation of final documentation. --<PAGE>OUTLOOKCapacity for American is expected to be down approximately two percent in thethird quarter of compared to last year\'s third quarter levels. AMR Eagle\'sthird quarter capacity will be down about one percent from last year\'s levels.For the third quarter of , the Company expects traffic to be about flat ascompared to last year\'s third quarter levels. Pressure to reduce costs willcontinue, although the Company will continue to see higher benefit and securitycosts, increased insurance premiums, and greater interest expense. However, theCompany expects to see a slight decrease in fuel prices as compared to the thirdquarter of and the continued decline in commission expense due to thecommission changes implemented earlier in . In total, American\'s unit costs,excluding special charges, for the third quarter of are expected to be downapproximately . percent from last year\'s third quarter level. Notwithstandingthe expected decrease in unit costs however, given the revenue pressures seen inthe first half of the year and expected to continue into the third quarter, theCompany expects to incur a sizable loss in the third quarter and a significantloss for .In response to these financial challenges, the Company has undertaken acomprehensive review of its business to better align its cost structure with thecurrent revenue environment, aimed at improving productivity, simplifyingoperations and reducing costs. The Company has begun to implement certain ofthese changes, including a fleet simplification program, adjustments to itsoperating schedule and increased airport automation, and will continue to refineits business throughout the coming months.FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATIONStatements in this report contain various forward-looking statements within themeaning of Section A of the Securities Act of , as amended, and SectionE of the Securities Exchange Act of , as amended, which represent theCompany\'s expectations or beliefs concerning future events.

The Company\'s first quarter results includea one-time, non-cash charge to record the cumulative effect of achange in accounting, effective January , , of million, or. per share, to write-off all of AMR\'s goodwill upon the adoptionof Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board No. ""Goodwilland Other Intangible Assets"" (see Note to the condensedconsolidated financial statements). AMR\'s operating loss of million increased million compared to the same period in .AMR\'s principal subsidiary is American Airlines, Inc. (American).The Company\'s first quarter revenues continued to decrease year-over-year. The Company\'s revenues continue to be negatively impactedby the economic slowdown, seen largely in business travel declines andchanges in business traveler profiles; the geographic distribution ofthe Company\'s network; and reduced fares due in large part toincreased competition from low-cost carriers. The Company\'s firstquarter revenues were also negatively impacted by the war in Iraqand the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). TheCompany\'s revenues decreased approximately million, or .percent, to . billion in the first quarter of from the sameperiod last year. American\'s passenger revenues decreased by .percent, or million, in the first three months of from thesame period in . American\'s domestic revenue per available seatmile (RASM) decreased . percent, to . cents, on a capacityincrease of . percent, to . billion available seat miles (ASMs).International RASM decreased to . cents, or . percent, on acapacity increase of . percent. The decrease in international RASMwas due to a . percent decrease in Pacific RASM slightly offset bya . percent increase in European RASM. Latin American RASM remainedflat. The increase in international capacity was driven by a .percent and . percent increase in Pacific and European ASMs,respectively, slightly offset by a . percent reduction in LatinAmerican ASMs.The Company\'s Regional Affiliates include two wholly ownedsubsidiaries, American Eagle Airlines, Inc. (American Eagle) andExecutive Airlines, Inc. (Executive) (collectively, AMR Eagle), andtwo independent carriers, Trans States Airlines, Inc. (Trans States)and Chautauqua Airlines, Inc. (Chautauqua). In , American had afixed fee per block hour agreement with Chautauqua, and prorateagreements with AMR Eagle and Trans States. In , American hadfixed fee per block hour agreements with all three carriers. The neteffect of the change in the form of the agreements was flat revenue.Regional Affiliates\' traffic increased . percent while capacityincreased . percent, to approximately . billion ASMs. Certainamounts from related to Regional Affiliates have beenreclassified to conform with the presentation.Other revenues increased . percent, or million, due primarilyto increases in ticket change fees coupled with changes to theCompany\'s change fee arrangements with travel agencies, increases inairfreight service fees due primarily to fuel surcharges and increasesin AAdvantage fees.The Company\'s operating expenses increased . percent, or million. Wages, salaries and benefits increased . percent, or million, primarily due to increases in pension and health insurancecosts and contractual wage rate and seniority increases that are builtinto the Company\'s labor contracts, offset by a reduction in theaverage number of employees. Aircraft fuel expense increased .percent, or million, due primarily to a . percent increase inAmerican\'s average price per gallon of fuel. Commissions, booking feesand credit card expense decreased . percent, or million, dueprimarily to commission structure changes implemented in March and a . percent decrease in passenger revenues. Maintenance,materials and repairs decreased . percent, or million, dueprimarily to a decrease in airframe and engine volumes at theCompany\'s maintenance bases resulting from a variety of factorsincluding the retirement of aircraft, the timing of engines returningfrom repair vendors and a decrease in the number of flights; and thereceipt of certain vendor credits. Aircraft rentals decreased million, or . percent, due primarily to lease expirations and theremoval of leased aircraft from service in prior periods. Foodservice decreased . percent, or million, due primarily toreductions in the level of food service. --<Page> Other income (expense), historically a net expense, increased million due to the following: Interest income decreased . percent,or million, due primarily to decreasing short-term investmentbalances. Interest expense increased million, or . percent,resulting primarily from the increase in the Company\'s long-term debt.Miscellaneous-net increased . percent, or million, due to thewrite-down of certain investments held by the Company during the firstquarter of .The Company has experienced significant cumulative losses and as aresult generated certain net operating losses available to offsetfuture taxes payable. As a result of the cumulative operating losses,a valuation allowance was established against the full amount of theCompany\'s net deferred tax asset as of December , . The Companyprovides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is morelikely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assetswill not be realized. During the first quarter of the Companycontinued to record a valuation allowance against its net deferred taxassets, which results in no tax benefit being recorded for the pretaxlosses. The Company\'s deferred tax asset valuation allowanceincreased million in the first quarter of , to millionas of March , .The effective tax rate for the three months ended March , wasimpacted by a million charge resulting from a provision inCongress\' economic stimulus package that changed the period forcarrybacks of net operating losses (NOLs). This change allowed theCompany to carry back and NOLs for five years, rather thantwo years under the previous law, allowing the Company to more quicklyrecover its NOLs. The extended NOL carryback did however result inthe displacement of foreign tax credits taken in prior years. Thesecredits are now expected to expire before being utilized by theCompany, resulting in this charge.<Table><Caption>OPERATING STATISTICS Three Months Ended March , <s> <c> <c>American Airlines, Inc.

Therequested . billion in savings was divided by work group asfollows: million - pilots; million - Transportation WorkersUnion represented employees; million - flight attendants; million - management and support staff; and million - agents andrepresentatives. References in this document to American\'s threemajor unions include: the Allied Pilots Association (the APA); theTransportation Workers Union (the TWU); and the Association ofProfessional Flight Attendants (the APFA).On March , , American announced that it had reached agreementswith its three major unions (the Labor Agreements). It also reportedvarious changes in the pay plans and benefits for non-unionizedpersonnel including officers and other management (the ManagementReductions). The anticipated cost savings arising from the LaborAgreements and the Management Reductions met the targeted annualsavings of . billion.On April , , the Company reported that the members of American\'sthree major unions had ratified the Labor Agreements. Thereafter,published reports of actions the Company had taken in to retainkey executives led two of the unions to indicate that they would notcertify the ratification process and might initiate another vote onthe Labor Agreements. The Company\'s actions included (i) the fundingof supplemental pension benefits for the officers of American by meansof a secular trust (the supplemental pension benefits provide benefitsthe officers would have received under the terms and conditions ofAmerican\'s defined benefit plans, but for limitations imposed byERISA) and (ii) the execution of retention agreements whereby Americanwould make cash payments to certain officers in January andJanuary . Given the economic turmoil affecting the Company and theindustry, in the Compensation Committee of the AMR Board ofDirectors decided that it was necessary to offer certain key officersretention agreements to ensure that the officers remained in theemploy of the Company for two years. In light of the controversysurrounding the retention agreements, they were voluntarily cancelledin April . --<Page> On April , , American announced that it had reached agreementwith the leaders of its three major unions on modifications to theLabor Agreements (the Modified Labor Agreements). The principalmodifications were a shorter duration and the ability to initiate theprocess of re-negotiating the Modified Labor Agreements after threeyears. Even with these modifications, the Modified Labor Agreementscontinue to meet the targeted annual savings. On April , , theCompany announced that its Board of Directors had accepted theresignation of Donald J. Carty (Chairman and CEO of the Company andAmerican). The Company also announced that Edward A. Brennan (aDirector of the Company since ) had been named Chairman of theCompany and that Gerard J. Arpey (President and COO of the Company andAmerican) had been named CEO and a director. On April , andApril , , the three major unions certified the ratification ofthe Modified Labor Agreements.Of the approximately . billion in savings, approximately .billion relate to wage and benefit reductions while the remainingapproximately . billion will be accomplished through changes in workrules which will result in additional job reductions. The Companyexpects to incur severance and benefits related charges in connectionwith these job reductions beginning in the second quarter of . Theamount of such charges could not be reasonably estimated at the timeof the filing of this Form -Q. Wage reductions became effective onApril , for officers and May , for all other employees.Reductions related to benefits and work rule changes will be phased inover time. The Company expects total savings from wages, benefits andwork rule changes to be approximately million in the secondquarter of , million in the third quarter of and million (. billion annually) in the fourth quarter of . Inconnection with the changes in wages, benefits and work rules, theModified Labor Agreements provide for the issuance of approximately million shares of AMR stock in the form of stock options which willgenerally vest over a three year period (see Note to the condensedconsolidated financial statements for additional information).In addition, subsequent to the ratification of the Modified LaborAgreements, the Company and American have reached concessionaryagreements with certain vendors, lessors, lenders and suppliers (theVendors, and with the agreements the Vendor Agreements). Generally,under the terms of these Vendor Agreements the Company or Americanwill receive the benefit of lower rates and charges for certain goodsand services, and more favorable rent and financing terms with respectto certain of its aircraft. In return for these concessions theCompany anticipates that it will issue over time up to . millionshares of AMR\'s common stock to Vendors who have reached agreementswith the Company. The annual cost savings from the Vendors areestimated to be in excess of million.Even with the Modified Labor Agreements, the savings from ManagementReductions and the Vendor Agreements, the Company may nonetheless needto initiate a filing under Chapter of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (aChapter filing) because its financial condition will remain weakand its prospects uncertain. Among other things, the followingfactors have had andor may have a negative impact on the Company\'sbusiness and financial results: the continued weakness of the U. S.economy; the residual effects of the war in Iraq; the fear of anotherterrorist attack; the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)outbreak; the inability of the Company to satisfy the liquidityrequirements or other covenants in certain of its credit arrangements(see Note to the condensed consolidated financial statements); orthe inability of the Company to access the capital markets foradditional financing.During and , the Company raised approximately . billion offunding to finance capital commitments and to fund operating losses.The Company expects that it will continue to need to raise significantadditional financing in the near future to cover its liquidity needs,until such time as (i) the cost initiatives discussed in the previousparagraphs become fully effective and (ii) the Company returns toprofitability. The Company had approximately . billion inunrestricted cash and short-term investments as of March , .The Company also had available possible future financing sources,including, but not limited to: (i) a limited amount of additionalsecured aircraft debt, (ii) sale-leaseback transactions of ownedproperty, including aircraft and real estate, (iii) securitization offuture operating receipts, and (iv) the potential sale of certain non-core assets (including the Company\'s interests in AMR Investments andWorldspan, a computer reservations systems partnership). However,these financing sources may not be available to the Company in lightof its financial condition. To the extent that the Company is unableto access capital markets and raise additional capital, the Companywill be unable to fund its obligations and sustain its operations. --<Page> In April , the President signed the Emergency Wartime SupplementalAppropriations Act, (the Act) which includes aviation-relatedassistance provisions. The Act authorizes payment of (i) millionto compensate air carriers for the direct costs associated with thestrengthening of flight deck doors and locks and (ii) . billion toreimburse air carriers for increased security costs which shall bedistributed in proportion to amounts each has paid or collected as ofthe date of enactment in passenger security and air carrier securityfees to the Transportation Security Administration. In addition, theAct suspends the collection of the passenger security fee from June , until October , and extends war-risk insurance throughAugust , . The Act also limits the total cash compensation forthe two most highly compensated named executive officers for certainairlines, including the Company, during the period April , toApril , to the amount of salary received by such officers in. A violation of this executive compensation provision wouldrequire the carrier to repay the government for the amount of itsreimbursement for increased security costs as described in item (ii)above. The Company does not anticipate any difficulties in complyingwith this limitation on executive compensation. The Company estimatesthat its reimbursement under the Act, excluding the impact ofsuspending the security fee from June , until October , ,will be in the range of million to million. Thisreimbursement will be recorded as a reduction to operating expenses.The Company\'s compensation for the direct costs associated withstrengthening cockpit doors will be recorded as a reduction tocapitalized flight equipment. The reimbursement payment from thegovernment is expected in May ; the compensation payment isexpected sometime this summer.AMR and American\'s credit ratings are significantly below investmentgrade. In January , Standard & Poor\'s and Moody\'s placed thecredit ratings of AMR and American on review for downgrade. InFebruary , Moody\'s further downgraded the senior implied ratingfor AMR, the senior unsecured ratings of both AMR and American and theratings of most of American\'s secured debt. The Moody\'s ratings remainon review for possible downgrade. Also in February , Standard &Poor\'s lowered its long-term corporate credit ratings for both AMR andAmerican, lowered the senior secured and unsecured debt ratings ofAMR, and lowered the secured debt rating of American. American\'sshort-term rating was withdrawn. Ratings on most of American\'s non-enhanced equipment trust certificates were also lowered. In addition,Standard & Poor\'s revised the CreditWatch implications to developingfrom negative. In March , Standard & Poor\'s further lowered itslong-term corporate credit ratings for both AMR and American, loweredthe senior secured and unsecured debt ratings of AMR, and lowered thesecured debt rating of American. Ratings on most of American\'s non-enhanced equipment trust certificates were also lowered. Thesereductions have increased the Company\'s borrowing costs. Additionalsignificant reductions in AMR\'s or American\'s credit ratings wouldfurther increase its borrowing or other costs and further restrict theavailability of future financing. Also in March , Standard &Poor\'s removed AMR\'s common stock from the S&P index.American has a fully drawn million credit facility that expiresDecember , . On March , , American and certain lenders insuch facility entered into a waiver and amendment that (i) waived,until May , , the requirement that American pledge additionalcollateral to the extent the value of the existing collateral wasinsufficient under the terms of the facility, (ii) waived American\'sliquidity covenant for the quarter ended March , , (iii)modified the financial covenants applicable to subsequent periods, and(iv) increased the applicable margin for advances under the facility.On May , , American expects to pledge an additional (non-Section eligible) aircraft having an aggregate net book value asof March , of approximately million. Pursuant to themodified financial covenants, American is required to maintain atleast . billion of liquidity, consisting of unencumbered cash andshort-term investments, for the second quarter and beyond. Atthis point, it is uncertain whether the Company will be able tosatisfy this liquidity requirement.In addition, the required ratio of EBITDAR to fixed charges has beendecreased until the period ending December , , and the next testof such cash flow coverage ratio will not occur until March , .The amendment also provided for a basis points increase in theapplicable margin over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR),resulting in an effective interest rate (as of March , ) of .percent. The interest rate will be reset again on September , .At American\'s option, interest on the facility can be calculated onone of several different bases. For most borrowings, American wouldanticipate choosing a floating rate based upon LIBOR. --<Page> The Company has restricted cash and short-term investments related toprojected workers\' compensation obligations and various otherobligations. As of March , , projected workers\' compensationobligations were secured by restricted cash and short-term investmentsof million and various other obligations were secured byrestricted cash and short-term investments of million. In thefirst quarter of , the Company redeemed million of tax-exemptbonds that were backed by standby letters of credit secured byrestricted cash and short-term investments resulting in a reduction inrestricted cash and short-term investments. Of the million of tax-exempt bonds that were redeemed, million were accounted for asoperating leases. Payments to redeem these tax-exempt specialfacility revenue bonds are considered prepaid facility rentals andwill reduce future operating lease commitments. The remaining million of tax-exempt bonds that were redeemed were accounted for asdebt and had original maturities in through .As of March , the Company has approximately million infuel prepayments and credit card holdback deposits classified as Othercurrent assets and Other assets.Net cash used for operating activities in the three-month period endedMarch , was million, a decrease of million over thesame period in . Included in net cash used for operatingactivities was the receipt of a million federal tax refund.Capital expenditures for the first three months of were million, and included the acquisition of three Boeing -ERs, fourEmbraer s and two Bombardier CRJ- aircraft. These capitalexpenditures were financed primarily through secured mortgage and debtagreements.During the three-month period ended March , , American and AMREagle borrowed approximately million under various debtagreements which are secured by aircraft. Effective interest rates onthese agreements are fixed or variable based on LIBOR plus a spreadand mature over various periods of time through . As of March ,, the effective interest rate on these agreements ranged up to. percent.As of March , , the Company had commitments to acquire thefollowing aircraft: two Boeing - ERs, six Boeing -ERs, Embraer regional jets and eight Bombardier CRJ-s in ; anaggregate of Embraer regional jets and seven Bombardier CRJ-s in through ; and an aggregate of Boeing -s and nineBoeing -ERs in through . Future payments for allaircraft, including the estimated amounts for price escalation, willapproximate million during the remainder of , million in, million in and an aggregate of approximately .billion in through . Boeing Capital Corporation has agreed toprovide backstop financing for all Boeing aircraft deliveries in .In return, American has granted Boeing a security interest in certainadvance payments previously made and in certain rights under theaircraft purchase agreement between American and Boeing. In addition,the Company has pre-arranged financing or backstop financing for allof its Embraer and Bombardier aircraft deliveries and a portionof its post deliveries.Special facility revenue bonds have been issued by certainmunicipalities primarily to purchase equipment and improve airportfacilities that are leased by American and accounted for as operatingleases. Approximately . billion of these bonds (with total futurepayments of approximately . billion as of March , ) areguaranteed by American, AMR, or both. These guarantees can only beinvoked in the event American defaults on the lease obligation andcertain other remedies are not available. Approximately millionof these special facility revenue bonds contain mandatory tenderprovisions that require American to repurchase the bonds at varioustimes through , including million in November . AlthoughAmerican has the right to remarket the bonds there can be no assurancethat these bonds will be successfully remarketed. Any payments toredeem or purchase bonds that are not remarketed would also beconsidered prepaid facility rentals and would reduce future operatinglease commitments. --<Page> OTHER INFORMATIONIn March , the Board of Directors of AMR approved the issuance ofadditional shares of AMR common stock to employees and Vendors inconnection with ongoing negotiations concerning concessions. Themaximum number of shares authorized for issuance was percent of thenumber of shares of the Company\'s common stock outstanding on March, (,,) or approximately . million shares. From theforegoing authorization, the Company expects to issue up to .million shares to Vendors. Also in March , the AMR Board ofDirectors adopted the Employee Stock Incentive Plan ( Plan)to provide equity awards to employees in connection with wage,benefit and work rule concessions. Under the Plan, all Americanemployees are eligible to receive stock awards which may include stockoptions, restricted stock and deferred stock. In April , theCompany reached final agreements with the unions representing Americanemployees (the Modified Labor Agreements, see Note to the condensedconsolidated financial statements). In connection with the changes inwages, benefits and work rules, the Modified Labor Agreements providefor the issuance of up to . million shares of AMR stock in theform of stock options. On April , approximately . millionstock options were granted to employees at an exercise price of .per share, which is equal to the closing price of AMR\'s common stock(NYSE) on that date (the grant date). These shares will vest over athree-year period and will expire no later than April , . Theseoptions were granted to members of the APA, the TWU, the APFA, agents,other non-management personnel and management employees.A provision in the scope clause of American\'s former contract with theAllied Pilots Associations (APA) limited the number of available seatmiles (ASMs) and block hours that could be flown under American\'smarketing code (AA) by American\'s regional carrier partners whenAmerican pilots are on furlough (the so-called ASM cap). To ensurethat American remained in compliance with the ASM cap, American andAmerican Eagle took several steps in to reduce the number of ASMsflown by American\'s wholly-owned commuter air carriers. As one ofthose measures, AMR Eagle signed a letter of intent to sell ExecutiveAirlines, its San Juan-based subsidiary.Another provision in the former APA contract limited to the totalnumber of regional jets with more than seats that could be flownunder the AA code by American\'s regional carrier partners. As AMREagle continued to accept previously-ordered Bombardier and Embraerregional jets this cap would have been reached in early . Toensure that American remained in compliance with the -aircraft cap,AMR Eagle reached an agreement to dispose of Embraer ERJ-aircraft from its fleet. Trans States Airlines, an AmericanConnectioncarrier, agreed to acquire these aircraft. Under the former contractbetween AA and the APA, Trans States would have had to operate theseaircraft under its AX code, rather than the AA* code, at its St. Louishub.The Labor Agreement with the APA (one of the Modified LaborAgreements), ratified in April , modified the provisions in theAPA contract described in the immediately preceding two paragraphs togive the Company more flexibility with its American Eagle operations.The limitations on the use of regional jets were substantially reducedand are now tied to percent of the size of American\'s narrowbodyaircraft fleet. As a consequence of these modifications, it is nolonger necessary to use the AX marketing code on flights operated byTrans States as the AmericanConnection, and AMR Eagle has discontinuedits plans to sell Executive Airlines. --<Page> FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATIONStatements in this report contain various forward-looking statementswithin the meaning of Section A of the Securities Act of , asamended, and Section E of the Securities Exchange Act of , asamended, which represent the Company\'s expectations or beliefsconcerning future events.

The Company\'s secondquarter results include million in security costreimbursements received under the Emergency Wartime SupplementalAppropriations Act, (the Act) (see Note to the condensedconsolidated financial statements for additional information). AMR\'sprincipal subsidiary is American Airlines, Inc. (American).The Company\'s second quarter revenues continued to decrease year-over-year, but at a slower rate than its capacity. In April, theCompany\'s revenues continued to be negatively impacted by the economicslowdown, the war in Iraq and the outbreak of Severe Acute RespiratorySyndrome (SARS). In May and June however, these trends reversed andwhile capacity was down year-over-year, the Company showed unitrevenue (passenger revenue per available seat mile) improvement.Overall, the Company\'s revenues decreased approximately million,or . percent, to . billion in the second quarter of from thesame period last year.

International RASM decreased to .cents, or . percent, on a capacity decrease of . percent. Thedecrease in international RASM was due to a . percent and .percent decrease in Pacific and Latin American RASM, respectively,slightly offset by a . percent increase in European RASM. Thedecrease in international capacity was driven by a . percent, .percent and . percent reduction in Pacific, European and LatinAmerican ASMs, respectively.The Company\'s Regional Affiliates include two wholly ownedsubsidiaries, American Eagle Airlines, Inc. and Executive Airlines,Inc. (collectively, AMR Eagle), and two independent carriers, TransStates Airlines, Inc. (Trans States) and Chautauqua Airlines, Inc.(Chautauqua).

The requested .billion in savings was divided by work group as follows: million- - pilots; million - Transportation Workers Union representedemployees; million - flight attendants; million - managementand support staff; and million - agents and representatives.References in this document to American\'s three major unions include:the Allied Pilots Association (the APA); the Transportation WorkersUnion (the TWU); and the Association of Professional Flight Attendants(the APFA).On March , , American announced that it had reached agreementswith its three major unions (the Labor Agreements). It also reportedvarious changes in the pay plans and benefits for non-unionizedpersonnel including officers and other management (the ManagementReductions). The anticipated cost savings arising from the LaborAgreements and the Management Reductions met the targeted annualsavings of . billion.On April , and April , , the three major unions certifiedthe ratification of the Labor Agreements with some modifications (theModified Labor Agreements). The principal modifications were ashorter duration and the ability to initiate the process of re-negotiating the Modified Labor Agreements after three years. Even withthese modifications, the Modified Labor Agreements continue to meetthe targeted annual savings. --<Page> Of the approximately . billion in estimated annual savings,approximately . billion relate to wage and benefit reductions whilethe remaining approximately . billion is expected to be accomplishedthrough changes in work rules, which will result in additional jobreductions. As a result of these additional job reductions, theCompany incurred million in severance charges in the secondquarter of (see Note to the condensed consolidated financialstatements for additional information). Wage reductions becameeffective on April , for officers and May , for all otheremployees. Reductions related to benefits and work rule changes willbe phased in over time. The Company expects total savings from wages,benefits and work rule changes to be million in the third quarterof and million in the fourth quarter of . In connectionwith the changes in wages, benefits and work rules, the Companygranted approximately million shares of AMR stock to American\'semployees in the form of stock options which will vest over a threeyear period with an exercise price of per share (see Note tothe condensed consolidated financial statements for additionalinformation).In addition, subsequent to the ratification of the Modified LaborAgreements, the Company and American reached concessionary agreementswith certain vendors, lessors, lenders and suppliers (collectively,the Vendors, and the agreements, the Vendor Agreements). Generally,under the terms of these Vendor Agreements the Company or Americanwill receive the benefit of lower rates and charges for certain goodsand services, and more favorable rent and financing terms with respectto certain of its aircraft. In return for these concessions, theCompany anticipates that it will issue - over time - up to . millionshares of AMR\'s common stock to Vendors. As of June , ,approximately . million shares have been issued to Vendors. As ofJune , , the annual cost savings from the Vendors are estimatedto be nearly million.The Company\'s revenue environment has improved during the secondquarter of as reflected in improved unit revenues (revenue peravailable seat mile) in May and June . Even with this improvementhowever, the Company\'s revenues are still depressed relative tohistorical levels and the Company\'s recent losses have adverselyaffected its financial condition. The Company therefore needs to seecontinued improvement in the revenue environment to return it tosustained profitability at acceptable levels.To maintain sufficient liquidity as the Company implements its plan toreturn to sustained profitability, the Company will need continuedaccess to additional funding, most likely through a combination offinancings and asset sales. In addition, the Company\'s ability toreturn to sustained profitability will depend on a number of riskfactors, many of which are largely beyond the Company\'s control.Among other things, the following factors have had andor may have anegative impact on the Company\'s business and financial results: theuncertain financial and business environment the Company faces, thestruggling economy, high fuel prices and the availability of fuel, theresidual effects of the war in Iraq, conflicts in the Middle East, theresidual effects of the SARS outbreak, historically low fare levels,the competitive environment, uncertainties with respect to theCompany\'s international operations, changes in its business strategy,actions by U.S. or foreign government agencies, the possibleoccurrence of additional terrorist attacks, or the inability of theCompany to satisfy existing liquidity requirements or other covenantsin certain of its credit arrangements. In particular, if the revenueenvironment deteriorates beyond normal seasonal trends, or the Companyis unable to access the capital markets or sell assets, it may beunable to fund its obligations and sustain its operations.During and , the Company raised approximately . billion offunding to finance capital commitments and to fund operating losses.The Company expects that it will need continued access to the capitalmarkets until such time as the Company returns to sustainedprofitability. The Company had approximately . billion inunrestricted cash and short-term investments as of June , . TheCompany also had available possible future financing sources,including, but not limited to: (i) a limited amount of additionalsecured aircraft debt (after giving effect to the July enhancedequipment trust certificates transaction described below, virtuallyall of the Company\'s Section -eligible aircraft are encumbered),(ii) sale-leaseback transactions of owned property, including aircraftand real estate, (iii) securitization of future operating receipts,(iv) unsecured debt, (v) equity and (vi) the potential sale of certainnon-core assets (including the Company\'s interests in AMRInvestments). However, the availability and level of these financingsources cannot be assured, particularly in light of the fact that theCompany has fewer unencumbered assets available than it had in thepast. To the extent that the Company\'s revenues deteriorate and it isunable to access capital markets and raise additional capital, theCompany may be unable to fund its obligations and sustain itsoperations. --<Page> In July , American issued million of enhanced equipment trustcertificates, secured by aircraft, which bear interest at . percentand are repayable in semi-annual installments beginning in , witha final maturity in . These obligations are insured by a thirdparty.The Company has a significant amount of indebtedness which could haveimportant consequences, such as (i) limiting the Company\'s ability toobtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures,acquisitions and general purposes, (ii) requiring the Company todedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations topayments on its indebtedness, (iii) making the Company more vulnerableto economic downturns, limiting its ability to withstand competitivepressures and reducing its flexibility in responding to changingbusiness and economic conditions, and (iv) limiting the Company\'sflexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its businessand the industry in which it operates.AMR and American\'s credit ratings are significantly below investmentgrade. In February , Moody\'s downgraded the senior implied ratingfor AMR, the senior unsecured ratings of both AMR and American and theratings of most of American\'s secured debt. Also in February ,Standard & Poor\'s lowered its long-term corporate credit ratings forboth AMR and American, lowered the senior secured and unsecured debtratings of AMR, and lowered the secured debt rating of American.American\'s short-term rating was withdrawn. Ratings on most ofAmerican\'s non-enhanced equipment trust certificates were alsolowered. In March , Standard & Poor\'s further lowered its long-term corporate credit ratings for both AMR and American, lowered thesenior secured and unsecured debt ratings of AMR, and lowered thesecured debt rating of American. Ratings on most of American\'s non-enhanced equipment trust certificates were also lowered. Theseprevious reductions have increased the Company\'s borrowing costs. OnJune , , Moody\'s affirmed the ratings of AMR and American,removed the ratings from review for possible downgrade, and gave theratings a negative outlook. On June , , Standard & Poor\'sraised its ratings of AMR and American and removed the ratings fromCreditWatch. Additional significant reductions in AMR\'s or American\'scredit ratings would further increase its borrowing or other costs andfurther restrict the availability of future financing. In March ,Standard & Poor\'s removed AMR\'s common stock from the S&P index.American has a fully drawn million credit facility that expiresDecember , . On March , , American and certain lenders insuch facility entered into a waiver and amendment that (i) waived,until May , , the requirement that American pledge additionalcollateral to the extent the value of the existing collateral wasinsufficient under the terms of the facility, (ii) waived American\'sliquidity covenant for the quarter ended March , , (iii)modified the financial covenants applicable to subsequent periods, and(iv) increased the applicable margin for advances under the facility.On May , , American pledged an additional (non-Section eligible) aircraft having an aggregate net book value as of April , of approximately million. Pursuant to the modifiedfinancial covenants, American is required to maintain at least .billion of liquidity, consisting of unencumbered cash and short-terminvestments, for the second quarter and beyond. While theCompany was in compliance with the covenant at June , , if theCompany is adversely affected by the risk factors discussed in Note to the condensed consolidated financial statements or elsewhere inthis Report, it is uncertain whether the Company will be able tosatisfy this liquidity requirement through the expiration of thefacility at the end of . Failure to do so or obtain a waiver ofthis requirement would result in a default under this facility andwould likely trigger defaults under a significant number of other debtarrangements.In addition, the required ratio of EBITDAR to fixed charges under thefacility has been decreased until the period ending December , ,and the next test of such cash flow coverage ratio will not occuruntil March , . The amendment also provided for a basispoint increase in the applicable margin over London Interbank OfferedRate (LIBOR), which resulted in an effective interest rate (as of June, ) of . percent. The interest rate will be reset again onSeptember , . At American\'s option, interest on the facilitycan be calculated on one of several different bases. For mostborrowings, American would anticipate choosing a floating rate basedupon LIBOR. --<Page> In April , the President signed the Act, which includes aviation-related assistance provisions. The Act authorized payment of (i) million to compensate air carriers for the direct costs associatedwith the strengthening of flight deck doors and locks and (ii) .billion to reimburse air carriers for increased security costs whichwas distributed in proportion to the amounts each carrier had paid orcollected in passenger security and air carrier security fees to theTransportation Security Administration as of the Act\'s enactment (theSecurity Fee Reimbursement). In addition, the Act suspends thecollection of the passenger security fee from June , untilOctober , and authorizes the extension of war-risk insurancethrough August , (and permits further extensions until December, ). The Act also limits the total cash compensation for thetwo most highly compensated named executive officers in forcertain airlines, including the Company, during the period April , to April , to the amount of salary received by suchofficers, or their successors, in . A violation of this executivecompensation provision would require the carrier to repay thegovernment for the amount of the Security Fee Reimbursement. TheCompany does not anticipate any difficulties in complying with thislimitation on executive compensation and believes the likelihood ofrepaying the government for the amount of the Security FeeReimbursement is remote. The Company\'s Security Fee Reimbursement was million (net of payments to independent regional affiliates) andwas recorded as a reduction to operating expenses during the secondquarter of . The Company\'s compensation for the direct costsassociated with strengthening flight deck doors will be recorded as areduction to capitalized flight equipment as such amounts arereceived.The Company has restricted cash and short-term investments related toprojected workers\' compensation obligations and various otherobligations of million as of June , . In the first quarterof , the Company redeemed million of tax-exempt bonds thatwere backed by standby letters of credit secured by restricted cashand short-term investments resulting in a reduction in restricted cashand short-term investments. Of the million of tax-exempt bondsthat were redeemed, million were accounted for as operatingleases. Payments to redeem these tax-exempt special facility revenuebonds are generally considered prepaid facility rentals and willreduce future operating lease commitments. The remaining millionof tax-exempt bonds that were redeemed were accounted for as debt andhad original maturities in through .As of June , the Company has approximately million in fuelprepayments and credit card holdback deposits classified as Othercurrent assets and Other assets in the condensed consolidated balancesheet.As discussed in Note to the condensed consolidated financialstatements, the Company reached concessionary agreements with certainlessors. The Vendor Agreements with these lessors affected thepayments, lease term, and other conditions of certain leases. As aresult of these changes to the payment and lease terms, leaseswhich were previously accounted for as operating leases wereconverted to capital leases, and one lease which was previouslyaccounted for as a capital lease was converted to an operating lease.The remaining leases did not change from their originalclassification. The Company recorded the new capital leases at thefair value of the respective assets being leased. These changes didnot have a significant effect on the Company\'s condensed consolidatedbalance sheet.In addition, certain of the concessionary agreements provide that theCompany\'s obligations under the related lease revert to the originalterms if certain events occur prior to December , , including:(i) an event of default under the related lease (which generallyoccurs only if a payment default occurs), (ii) an event of loss withrespect to the related aircraft, (iii) rejection by the Company ofthe lease under the provisions of Chapter of the U.S. BankruptcyCode or (iv) the Company\'s filing for bankruptcy under Chapter ofthe Bankruptcy Code. If any one of these events were to occur, theCompany would be responsible for approximately million inadditional lease payments as of June , . This amount willincrease to million prior to the expiration of the provision onDecember , . Such amounts are being treated as contingentrentals and will only be recognized if they become due. --<Page> As part of the Vendor Agreements discussed in Note to the condensedconsolidated financial statements, American entered into an agreementto transfer Fokker aircraft (with minimal net book value as ofJune , ) to a lender in the third quarter of . In return,the lender has agreed to restructure approximately million indebt related to certain of these aircraft. In addition, American willprovide shares of AMR common stock to the lender as discussed in Note to the condensed consolidated financial statements. However, therestructured debt agreement contains certain provisions that wouldrequire American to repay certain amounts of the original debt ifcertain events occur prior to December , , including: (i) anevent of default (which generally occurs only if a payment defaultoccurs), (ii) an event of loss with respect to the related aircraft,(iii) rejection by the Company of the lease under the provisions ofChapter of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or (iv) the Company\'s filingfor bankruptcy under Chapter of the Bankruptcy Code. The Companyexpects to recognize a significant gain as a result of thisrestructuring, with the majority of the gain recognized in the thirdquarter of , and the remainder recognized on December , , ifnone of the above events have occurred.Net cash provided by operating activities in the six-month periodended June , was million, an increase of million overthe same period in . Included in net cash provided by operatingactivities the first six months of was the receipt of a million federal tax refund and the receipt of million from thegovernment under the Act. Included in net provided by operatingactivities for the first six months of was approximately million received by the Company as a result of the utilization of its NOLs. Capital expenditures for the first six months of were million, and included the acquisition of seven Boeing -ERs,two Boeing - ERs, ten Embraer s and four Bombardier CRJ-aircraft. These capital expenditures were financed primarily throughsecured mortgage and debt agreements.During the six-month period ended June , , American and AMREagle borrowed approximately million under various debtagreements which are secured by aircraft and other property. Theseagreements have effective interest rates which are fixed or variablebased on LIBOR plus a spread and mature over various periods of timethrough . As of June , , the effective interest rate onthese agreements ranged up to . percent.In June , the Company sold its interest in Worldspan, a computerreservations company, for million in cash and a millionpromissory note, resulting in a gain of million which is includedin Other income (loss) in the consolidated statement of operations.As of June , , the Company had commitments to acquire thefollowing aircraft: two Boeing -ERs, Embraer regional jetsand seven Bombardier CRJ-s in ; an aggregate of Embraerregional jets and six Bombardier CRJ-s in through ; and anaggregate of Boeing -s and nine Boeing -ERs in through . Future payments for all aircraft, including theestimated amounts for price escalation, will approximate millionduring the remainder of , million in , million in and an aggregate of approximately . billion in through. Boeing Capital Corporation has agreed to provide backstopfinancing for all Boeing aircraft deliveries in . In return,American has granted Boeing a security interest in certain advancepayments previously made and in certain rights under the aircraftpurchase agreement between American and Boeing. In addition, theCompany has pre-arranged financing or backstop financing for all ofits Embraer and Bombardier aircraft deliveries and a portion ofits post deliveries.Special facility revenue bonds have been issued by certainmunicipalities primarily to purchase equipment and improve airportfacilities that are leased by American and accounted for as operatingleases. Approximately . billion of these bonds (with total futurepayments of approximately . billion as of June , ) areguaranteed by American, AMR, or both. These guarantees can only beinvoked in the event American defaults on the lease obligation andcertain other remedies are not available. Approximately millionof these special facility revenue bonds contain mandatory tenderprovisions that require American to repurchase the bonds at varioustimes through , including million in November . AlthoughAmerican has the right to remarket the bonds there can be no assurancethat these bonds will be successfully remarketed. Any payments toredeem or purchase bonds that are not remarketed would generally beconsidered prepaid facility rentals and would reduce future operatinglease commitments. --<Page> The following table summarizes the Company\'s obligations andcommitments as of June , , to be paid in through (inmillions):<Table><Caption> <s> <c> <c> <c> <c> <c>Nature of commitment () Operating lease payments for aircraft and facility obligations () , , Firm aircraft commitments () Fee per block hour commitments () Long-term debt () , , ,Capital lease obligations Other commitments () - Total obligations and commitments , , , , ,<Table> () Certain special facility revenue bonds issued by municipalities - which are supported by operating leases executed by American - are guaranteed by AMR and American. () Substantially all of the commitment is supported by committed financing. () Includes expected payments based on projected volumes rather than minimum required payments. () Excludes related interest amounts. () Includes noncancelable commitments to purchase goods or services, primarily information technology support. Other commitments for the remainder of are not significant. () Amounts are as of June , .In addition to the commitments summarized above, the Company isrequired to make contributions to its defined benefit pension plans.These contributions are required under the minimum fundingrequirements of the Employee Retirement Pension Plan Income SecurityAct (ERISA). The Company\'s minimum required pension contributionsare approximately million and the Company\'s estimated minimum required pension contributions are million. Due touncertainties regarding significant assumptions involved in estimatingfuture required contributions, such as pension plan benefit levels,interest rate levels and the amount and timing of asset returns, theCompany is not able to reasonably estimate the amount of futurerequired contributions beyond . However, based on the currentregulatory environment and market conditions, the Company expects its minimum required pension contributions to significantly exceedits minimum required pension contributions.OTHER INFORMATIONA provision in the scope clause of American\'s prior contract with theAllied Pilots Associations (APA) limited the number of available seatmiles (ASMs) and block hours that could be flown under American\'smarketing code (AA) by American\'s regional carrier partners whenAmerican pilots are on furlough (the so-called ASM cap). To ensurethat American remained in compliance with the ASM cap, American andAmerican Eagle took several steps in to reduce the number of ASMsflown by American\'s wholly-owned commuter air carriers. As one ofthose measures, AMR Eagle signed a letter of intent to sell ExecutiveAirlines, its San Juan-based subsidiary.Another provision in the prior APA contract limited to the totalnumber of regional jets with more than seats that could be flownunder the AA code by American\'s regional carrier partners. As AMREagle continued to accept previously-ordered Bombardier and Embraerregional jets this cap would have been reached in early . Toensure that American remained in compliance with the -aircraft cap,AMR Eagle reached an agreement to dispose of Embraer ERJ-aircraft from its fleet. Trans States Airlines, an AmericanConnectioncarrier, agreed to acquire these aircraft. Under the prior contractbetween AA and the APA, Trans States would have had to operate theseaircraft under its AX code, rather than the AA* code, at its St. Louishub. --<Page> The Labor Agreement with the APA (one of the Modified LaborAgreements), ratified in April , modified the provisions in theAPA contract described in the immediately preceding two paragraphs togive the Company more flexibility with its American Eagle operations.The limitations on the use of regional jets were substantially reducedand are now tied to percent of the size of American\'s narrowbodyaircraft fleet. As a consequence of these modifications, it is nolonger necessary to use Trans States\' AX marketing code on flightsoperated by Trans States as the AmericanConnection, and AMR Eagle hasdiscontinued its plans to sell Executive Airlines. In addition, AMREagle has revised its agreement to dispose of Embraer ERJ-aircraft to include ten rather than aircraft.The Company carries insurance for public liability, passengerliability, property damage and all-risk coverage for damage to itsaircraft. As a result of the September , events, aviationinsurers have significantly reduced the amount of insurance coverageavailable to commercial air carriers for liability to persons otherthan employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts ofterrorism, war or similar events (war-risk coverage). At the sametime, they significantly increased the premiums for such coverage aswell as for aviation insurance in general. The U.S. government hasprovided commercial war-risk insurance for U.S. based airlines untilAugust , covering losses to employees, passengers, thirdparties and aircraft. The Company believes this insurance coveragewill be extended beyond August , because the Act provides forthe insurance to remain in place until August , , and theDepartment of Transportation has stated its intent to do so. Inaddition, the Secretary of Transportation may extend the policy untilDecember , , at his discretion. However, there is no guaranteethat it will be extended. In the event the commercial insurancecarriers further reduce the amount of insurance coverage available tothe Company or significantly increase the cost of aviation insurance,or if the Government fails to renew the war-risk insurance that itprovides, the Company\'s operations andor financial position andresults of operations would be materially adversely affected.FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATIONStatements in this report contain various forward-looking statementswithin the meaning of Section A of the Securities Act of , asamended, and Section E of the Securities Exchange Act of , asamended, which represent the Company\'s expectations or beliefsconcerning future events.

In order to provide ameasure of control over price and supply, the Company trades and shipsfuel and maintains fuel storage facilities to support its flightoperations. The Company also manages the price risk of fuel costsprimarily by using jet fuel, heating oil, and crude swap and optioncontracts. As of June , , the Company had hedged approximately percent of its expected fuel needs for the remainder of ,approximately percent of its expected first quarter fuel needsand an insignificant percentage of its expected fuel needs beyond thefirst quarter of , compared to approximately percent of itsestimated fuel requirements, percent of its estimated fuel requirements, and approximately four percent of its estimated fuel requirements hedged at December , . Beginning in March, the Company revised its hedging strategy and, in June ,terminated substantially all of its contracts with maturities beyondMarch . The Company's reduced credit rating has limited itsability to enter into certain types of fuel hedge contracts. Afurther deterioration of its credit rating or liquidity position maynegatively affect the Company's ability to hedge fuel in the future.For additional information see Note to the condensed consolidatedfinancial statements.Item ""]",

Under this program, the Company hassought to assess all of its critical software and hardware products to determinewhat remediation, if any, is necessary for the proper functioning of thesesystems in the year and beyond. The Company is also working with itsoutside vendors to ensure that they will continue to support the products thatthe vendors supply to Anacomp for resale, including the performance by thevendors of any required Year remediation.Anacomp is also in the process of analyzing the software and hardware systemsthat it uses internally to determine if there are any Year issues. Wherenecessary, the Company is updating its internal systems and working with thevendors of any products from whom the Company still receives support.Based upon its assessment to date, Anacomp believes that it will be able tocomplete all required remediation of its supported and internal products in atimely fashion, and that the effort and the cost of such remediation will nothave a material effect upon the Company\'s results of operations, liquidity orcapital resources. The Company expenses these costs as they are incurred.Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able tocomplete all of such remediation in the required time frame, or that the Companywill be able to identify all Year issues before problems manifestthemselves. Further, it is possible that the future level of expenses in theCompany\'s remediation efforts could rise significantly. Finally, there can be noassurance that, if left unremedied, the products that the Company sells ordistributes would remain competitive in the marketplace or the products that theCompany uses internally would not have a material effect upon the ability of theCompany to report its financial results.Anacomp has set a goal of completing its Year program, including allrequired remediation work, by December , , both for the products that itsupports and for the products that it uses internally. The Company is hopeful,however, that it will complete its program for certain of its products beforethat internal deadline.Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements in this ""Management\'s Decision and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations"" and elsewhere in this report constitute""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private SecuritiesLitigation Reform Act of .

For reporting purposes, the acquisition datewas set as June , . The First Image acquisition resulted in incrementalrevenues and EBITDA (defined on page ) of . million and . million,respectively, for the period June , to September , , and areincluded in the Company\'s results of operations for the fiscal year endedSeptember , . See Note to the accompanying Consolidated FinancialStatements for additional information related to this acquisition. On May , , the Company\'s Reorganization Plan was confirmed by theUnited States Bankruptcy Court and on June , , the Company emerged frombankruptcy reorganization. The Plan of Reorganization resulted in a reduction ofapproximately million in principal and accrued interest on the Company\'sdebt obligations and in liquidation amount and accrued dividends on itspreferred stock. As a result of the Reorganization, the recording of therestructuring transaction and the implementation of Fresh Start Reporting, theCompany\'s results of operations after May , (the cutoff date used forfinancial reporting purposes) are not comparable to results reported in priorperiods. See Note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements forinformation on the consummation of the Plan of Reorganization and implementationof Fresh Start Reporting. To facilitate a meaningful comparison of the Company\'s quarterly andyear-to-date operating performance in fiscal years , and , thefollowing discussion of consolidated results of operations is presented on atraditional comparative basis for all periods. Consequently, the informationpresented below for fiscal does not comply with accounting requirements forcompanies upon emergence from bankruptcy, which requirements call for separatereporting for the newly reorganized company and the predecessor company. <PAGE>CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSANACOMP, INC.

The Company and Kodak negotiated an amendment tothe OEM agreement, whereby the Company accepted a . million cash payment fromKodak, which is included in the results for fiscal , a commitment topurchase an additional XFP systems and a one-time purchase of spareparts. Kodak purchased XFP systems in fiscal and in fiscal thereby fulfilling their obligation under the amended agreement. Earnings before interest, other income, reorganization items, specialand restructuring charges, taxes, depreciation and amortization andextraordinary items (""EBITDA"") was . million, or . of revenues for theyear ended September , . This compares to EBITDA of . million, or. of revenues, and . million, or . of revenues for the years endedSeptember , and , respectively. Excluding the Kodak payment of .million described above, EBITDA for fiscal was . million or . ofrevenues.FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER , VS. FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER , REVENUES. The Company\'s revenues increased . from . million infiscal to . million in fiscal . The Company experienced increasedrevenues of . million and . million in its Outsource Services and OutputSystems business lines, respectively, while experiencing decreasing revenues of. million in its Micrographic Supplies product lines. The . million increase in Outsource Service revenues was primarilydue to the acquisition of First Image and the inclusion of its operating resultsfor the four months ending September , (. million). Additionally,excluding the results of the First Image, COM service volumes increased byapproximately while average selling prices decreased by approximately .Certain data center acquisitions in Europe and several large customer gainscontributed to both the increase in volumes and the decrease in average sellingprices. The . million increase in Output Systems revenues was primarily dueto a . million increase in COM systems sales which was the result of both anincrease in the number of units sold as well as the pricing of new and usedsystems. The Company sold or leased XFP units in fiscal comparedto in fiscal . Digital systems revenues increased by . million whichwas primarily the result of the Com-Informatic acquisition that was consummatedin October . The . million decrease in Micrographics Supplies revenues was theresult of the Company\'s discontinuance of the sale of duplicate film to thereseller market, as well as declining sales of original COM film and duplicatefilm, which is consistent with long-term trends. GROSS MARGIN. The Company\'s gross margins increased . from .million (. of revenues) in fiscal to . million (. of revenues)in fiscal (excluding the Kodak payment in fiscal ). Gross margins as apercentage of revenues remained relatively flat on a consolidated basis althoughthere were fluctuations within certain business lines. Gross margins generatedby Outsource Services decreased as a percent of revenue by . which wasprimarily the result of decreases in COM services average selling prices. Thedecrease in average selling prices was in part due to the large customer gainswhich received favorable pricing due to their large volumes and acquisitionswhich increased sales volume at lower average <PAGE>selling prices. Gross margins generated by COM systems sales as a percent of revenue increased by approximately . which was primarily due to product mix and the result of manufacturing efficiencies realized during fiscal . SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general andadministrative (""SG&A"") expenses increased . from . million (. ofrevenues) in fiscal to . million (. of revenues) in fiscal .This increase is primarily due to the increased expenses associated with theFirst Image and Com-Informatic acquisitions. Additionally, the Company increasedits sales efforts, sales support and product development for the digital systemsproducts. The Company experienced lower SG&A expenses as a percentage ofrevenues (. of revenues) during the fourth quarter of fiscal . Thisdecrease in SG&A was the result of additional revenues from First Image alongwith the benefit from sales force reductions which occurred in the thirdquarter. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS . Amortization of intangible assetsincreased . from . million (. of revenues) in fiscal to .million (. of revenues) in fiscal . This increase is primarily due to theamortization of goodwill associated with the First Image acquisition. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES. Restructuring charges totaled . million (.of revenues) in fiscal . These charges resulted from the Company\'sacquisition of First Image as the Company plans to close down Anacomp sites withmultiple market presence in certain cities and convert First Image customers toAnacomp equipment. These restructuring activities are expected to be completedduring fiscal year . The restructuring charges consist of personnel relatedcosts of . million, facility closedown costs of . million, and other costsof . million. The Company incurred . million of personnel costs primarilyrelated to severance expenditures and . million of other administrative costsduring the year ended September , . INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense decreased . from . million infiscal to . million in fiscal . This decrease was the result of theCompany refinancing substantially all of its debt obligations at lower interestrates during fiscal and which was partially offset by additionalborrowings used to finance the acquisition of First Image. The Company iscurrently anticipating that interest expense will increase to levels similar tothat which was experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal . Interestexpense increased . million from . million in the fourth quarter of fiscal to . million in the fourth quarter of fiscal . PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The provision for income taxes in fiscal includes . million on earnings of Anacomp\'s foreign subsidiaries and. million of domestic taxes after considering the impact of the extraordinaryloss. Of the . million domestic tax provision, approximately . million iscurrently payable. The Company\'s effective tax rate decreased by approximately from of taxable income in fiscal to of taxable income in .This decrease was primarily due to a substantial portion of the taxable incomebeing generated in countries with lower income tax rates relative to the priorperiod. See Note to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements forfurther discussion.FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER , VS. FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER , REVENUES. The Company\'s revenues decreased . from . million infiscal to . million in fiscal . The Company experienced decreasedrevenues of . million and . million in its Micrographic Supplies andMagnetic Media business lines, respectively, which was offset by increasedrevenues of . million in its Output Systems product lines. The . million decrease in Micrographic Supplies revenues includes adecrease of . million related to the discontinuance and downsizing ofselected product lines initiated in fiscal . The remaining decrease wasconsistent with the projected market trends for reader and readerprinters,original COM film, duplicate film and other accessories. The Magnetic Media revenues decreased by . million due to expecteddeclining sales in several major product categories including tapecartridges (. million), open reel tape (. million) and TK tape (.million). These decreases were partially offset by new contributions of .million from metal particle tape products. <PAGE> The . million increase in Output Systems revenues is primarilyattributable to digital systems sales. Digital systems sales increased by .million which was primarily the result of the revenue contribution from theDataWare acquisition that was consummated in January . Prior to thatacquisition, there were no digital system sales. These sales were offset by a. million decrease in COM systems revenues. This reduction resulted from anincrease in in the number of COM system units shipped under operating leasearrangements, and a decrease in the number of systems shipped under straightsales arrangements along with a change in the mix and pricing of new and usedsystems GROSS MARGIN. The Company\'s gross margins increased by less than asa percentage of revenues from . million (. of revenues) in fiscal to . million (. of revenues) in fiscal (the fiscal marginexcludes the Kodak payment). Gross margins remained relatively flat on aconsolidated basis although there were fluctuations within certain businesslines. Gross margins generated by Outsource Services decreased as a percent ofrevenue by approximately which was primarily the result of a decrease in COMservices average selling prices. Data center acquisitions and several largecustomer gains resulted in increased volumes with a corresponding decrease inaverage selling prices. Gross margins generated by Technical Services as apercent of revenue increased by approximately which was primarily due to costreduction efforts in maintenance services initiated by new management. OutputSystems gross margins as a percentage of revenues increased by approximately due to a change in product mix with a greater portion of sales represented byrefurbished systems which have higher margins. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. SG&A expenses increasedless than from . million (. of revenues) in fiscal to .million (. of revenues) in fiscal . This increase was primarily theresult of transition costs associated with the Company\'s fiscal acquisitionactivity. INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense decreased . from . million infiscal to . million in fiscal . This decrease was primarily due tothe Company\'s refinancing efforts in fiscal and its improved debt structureas a result of the Company\'s reorganization in fiscal . PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The provision for income taxes in fiscal includes . million on earnings from Anacomp\'s foreign subsidiaries and. million of domestic taxes after considering the impact of the extraordinaryloss. Of the . million domestic tax provision, approximately . million iscurrently payable. See Note to the accompanying Consolidated FinancialStatements for further discussion.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES During the period ended September , , Anacomp issued millionof Senior Subordinated Notes which proceeds were used to fund the FirstImage acquisition. As of September , the Company had million of Senior Subordinated Notes outstanding. Interest on these notes is payablesemi-annually and the notes are due in April, . Anacomp\'s working capital at September , , excluding the currentportion of long-term debt, was . million, compared to . million atSeptember , . Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to .million for the fiscal year ended September , , compared to . millionin the comparable prior period. Fiscal benefited from million innon-cash interest expense and significant reductions in long-term leasereceivables and inventory. Fiscal did not include the same benefits and, inaddition, current liabilities were significantly reduced during the year. Net cash used in investing activities was . million in the currentperiod, compared to . million in the comparable prior period. This changewas primarily the result of the First Image acquisition in the current period. Net cash provided by financing activities increased to . millionfor the fiscal year ended September , , compared to a net use of .million in the comparable prior period. This change was primarily the result ofthe Company\'s issuance of million of Senior Subordinated notesduring the current period which was offset by the pay off of senior indebtednessoutstanding at the end of fiscal . <PAGE> The Company\'s cash balance (including restricted cash) as of September, was . million, compared to . million at September , . TheCompany also has available an million revolving credit facility. There wereno amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of September ,. The Company has significant debt service obligations. The ability ofthe Company to meet its debt service and other obligations will depend upon itsfuture performance and is subject to financial, economic and other factors, someof which are beyond its control. However, the Company believes that cash on handand cash generated from operations and cash available under the revolving creditfacility will be sufficient to fund its debt service requirements, acquisitionstrategies and working capital requirements in the foreseeable future.YEAR Anacomp has undertaken a comprehensive ""year "" program for theproducts that it sells or distributes in the marketplace. Under this program,the Company has assessed all of its critical software and hardware products todetermine what remediation, if any, is necessary for the proper functioning ofthese systems in the year and beyond. The Company has worked with itsoutside vendors to ensure that they will continue to support the products thatthe vendors supply to Anacomp for resale, including the performance by thevendors of any required year remediation. Anacomp has also analyzed andupdated for year purposes certain software and hardware systems that ituses internally. The Company continues to consider year issues for all newproducts and services as well as those in development or included in businessacquisitions. STATE OF READINESS Anacomp\'s overall state of readiness can be assessed by describing itsspecific readiness in four key areas, namely its products and services, itsvendors\' and suppliers\' products and services, its internal systems, and itsproducts in development. Anacomp has completed the assessment, remediation and year testingphases of nearly all supported products and services, including thoseresponsible for generating the material portion of its revenues. The Company iscurrently in the remediation phase of its electronic data transmission project.Anacomp summarizes the status of each completed product or service in a writtenreport to the Company\'s year steering committee, for archiving in theCompany\'s year database. These processes have been reviewed and approved bya third party consultant retained for this purpose. The implementation phase of the Company\'s year project depends onthe response of the Company\'s customers who may require upgrades or migrationpaths. Anacomp is in the process of communicating with identified customers andhas no reason to believe that all customers who require upgrades or migrationwill not receive them. To this end, Anacomp has offered financial incentives toencourage early responses and avoid peak demand loads, although no assurance canbe made that the demand will be spread sufficiently to eliminate delays inimplementation. Anacomp has also launched its ""Analog as a Fail Safe"" campaignto educate customers about the value of COM and microfilm as a way to minimizethe risk of the year . Although customers may divert expenditures away fromthese products and services in order to fund other year remediation,Anacomp encourages customers to consider these products and services as acost-effective backup to digital storage because retrieval of data stored onmicrofilm does not require digital technology. The Company has requested that approximately , of its vendors andsuppliers answer a year readiness questionnaire and has sent a follow-upletter and questionnaire to each of approximately key vendors and supplierswho did not reply to the first mailing. Anacomp is in the process of reviewingthe responses for their likely impact on the Company. For those Anacomp productswhich incorporate the products of a third party supplier, Anacomp requests thatits suppliers disclose test procedures and results. Anacomp has also requestedthat its vendors in the human resources area, such as its retirement, health andinsurance providers, respond in writing as to their readiness, but there can beno assurance that such vendors will either respond or achieve readiness in atimely fashion. <PAGE> Anacomp has identified all internal software and hardware products usedin its corporate headquarters in Poway, California, including those used toassimilate and report financial information and to handle billing, collectionsand electronic commerce. In those instances where remediation or renovation wasrequired, Anacomp has either completed or has nearly completed such remediationor renovation. Anacomp is in the process of completing the documentation of suchefforts for its year archives. The Company continues to develop new products and services and acquirenew businesses. Anacomp develops and tests each new product, sometimes with theassistance of an outside consultant, for year readiness. Businesses whichAnacomp acquires, such as First Image, are subject to the same assessment,remediation, testing and implementation phases as those described above. COSTS Anacomp estimates that total expenditures on its year project,including costs of outside parties such as consultants and attorneys, costs ofhardware and software remediation, internal labor, travel and out of pocketexpenses to be approximately ., ., and . million in fiscal year ,, and , respectively. These figures include estimates from theengineering, manufacturing, legal and information technology departments of theCompany. RISKS There can be no assurance that the Company and its vendors andsuppliers will be able to identify all year issues before problems manifestthemselves or to complete all remediation in the required time frame. Further,it is possible that the future level of expenses in the Company\'s remediationefforts could rise significantly. The Company relies upon the continuous provision of services from thirdparties such as electrical and telecommunication utilities around the world, andthe Company plans to enhance its electronic data transmission capabilities. Anysustained disruption of service or capability could adversely impact theCompany\'s ability to operate its business. Finally, there can be no assurancethat, if left unremedied, the products or services that the Company sells ordistributes would remain competitive in the marketplace or the products that theCompany uses internally would not have a material effect upon the ability of theCompany to report its financial results. CONTINGENCY PLANS In those instances where the Company determines that year problemswith its operational facilities may not be identified or remediated in time, theCompany believes that its business will still be able to function withoutsubstantial interruption. For example, COM services provided in a data centerwhich experiences a loss of power due to a third party utility\'s failure toidentify or remediate an isolated year problem could be shifted to anotherdata center without substantial interruption. In addition, electronictransmission of data could be replaced with manual delivery of data uponcompletion of certain modifications. In those instances where an installed COMcustomer experiences a year problem while operating its own COM equipment,Anacomp could offer its COM services to the customer at one of its data centersupon completion of certain modifications. This seamless nature of many ofAnacomp\'s products and services forms the basis of Anacomp\'s ongoing contingencyplanning.ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June , the FASB issued two additional pronouncements related toreporting comprehensive income and disclosure of segment information. These twopronouncements are effective for fiscal years beginning after December , .The Company has not yet determined the additional disclosures specified by thesepronouncements on the consolidated financial statements for the year endedSeptember , , which will be reported during fiscal . <PAGE>EURO CURRENCY Many of the countries in which the Company sells its products andservices are Member States of the Economic and Monetary Union (""EMU""). BeginningJanuary , , Member States of the EMU may begin trading in either theirlocal currencies or the euro, the official currency of EMU participating MemberStates. Parties are free to choose the unit they prefer in contractualrelationships during the transitional period, beginning January and endingJune . The Company\'s computer system contains the functionality to processtransactions in either a country\'s local currency or the euro. The Company doesnot currently anticipate any material adverse effects on its operations relatedto the EMU\'s conversion to the euro. However, there can be no assurance that theconversion of EMU Member States to euro will not have a material adverse effecton the Company and its operations.ITEM ']","['Item A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Item ', ""ITEM A.
